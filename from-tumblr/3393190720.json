Neat.\r\nprogrammer 2: Yeah, but it'll break.\r\np1: But... that's just it, it *doesn't* break.  It's actually ok for me to do this.\r\np2: No it isn't.\r\np1: Why not?\r\np2: Browser bugs.\r\np1: Which browsers?\r\np2: All of them.\r\np1: Well, it works fine on all the engines I've tested---\r\np2: IE.\r\np1: Works fine there, too.  Even in IE 5.\r\np2: Compression.  Compressors can't handle it. Need the semicolons.  All of them.\r\np1: All the compressors in use today handle it fine.  In fact, the code compresses a little *better* in most of them.\r\np2: Well, whatever, that's not how it's done.\r\np1: Ok, well, there are other reasons to do things besides a convention.  I mean, you're wearing an unconventional hat, and that's cool.\r\np2: So, now you have a problem with my coding style AND my hat?? FUCK YOU.\r\np1: You can code however you want, and I love your hat, I was ju---\r\np2: No.  NO.  Fuck you.  Seriously.  You crossed a line, dude.  Too far.\r\np1: [puzzled] I don't get why this an issue, I mean, if you see the spec, it says---\r\np2: You just can't let this go, can you?  Why don't you lighten up?\r\np1: Let what go, exactly?  And I don't really think that I'm the one who needs to lighten anything.\r\np2: Oh, so now you come in with the personal attacks.  I get it.  We're all not smart enough to understand your precious spec, so you have to attack people?  HAVE YOU NO DECENCY, SIR?  AT LONG LAST, HAVE YOU NO DECENCY?\r\np1: I think maybe hacker news isn't for me...",
