However, in the modern world, the\nabsurdity of this pattern seems so painfully clear sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>Christmas just a few generations ago would have been <em>unrecognizable</em> to us\ntoday.  The &ldquo;Santa Claus&rdquo; character as we know him today, with the reindeer\nand flying and chimneys and north pole, was invented\nless than 200 years ago, and only became an overweight bearded red-clad man in\nthe 1920s.  Our &ldquo;classic&rdquo; christmas songs were almost all written\nin the 1940s and 1950s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A lot of our &ldquo;time-honored&rdquo; christmas traditions were invented while\nmy parents were kids.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The christmas traditions that I remember were waking up early, opening\npresents, and then spending the day in pyjamas playing with new toys.\nNo travelling, no extended family, no huge dinner.  We didn&rsquo;t have any\nxmas eve celebration (probably because my parents did a lot of their\nshopping and preparation the night before.)  The &ldquo;christmas dinner&rdquo; was\nusually delivery chinese.  Normal Rockwell would&rsquo;ve been scandalized.</p>\n\n<p>The extravagance of our christmas presents varied quite a lot.\nMy dad ran his own business, and along with that came a lot of\nups and downs.  When we didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money, my parents put\na lot of creativity into it.</p>\n\n<p>One year, our gifts consisted mainly of coupons to be redeemed for\noutings or favors at some later date.  We were young enough to be\nexcited about that.  Those coupons were made at home, printed\nto look official and then decorated with magic marker (our printer at\nthe time was a black and white dot-matrix.)</p>\n\n<p>The most awesome part of our xmas tradition came out of a creative\nsolution to a last-minute problem.  It was a good year, and my parents\nhad bought me\nand my sister new bicycles.  But, they didn&rsquo;t see any way to bring them\ninto the living room and wrap them in such a way that we wouldn&rsquo;t know\nright away what they were.</p>\n\n<p>They had the innovative idea to put the bikes outside in the shed,\nbut rather than just tell us to go out and get them, my mom designed a\ntreasure hunt that my sister and I would have to work together\nto solve.  The first clue was on a card buried in the middle of the\ntree.  That led to another clue, which led to another, and so on.  Each\none was a little puzzle that had to be solved, and it was all allegedly\nfrom &ldquo;Santa&rdquo;.  So, when we asked my mom for help, she just threw up her\nhands, and said, &ldquo;Hey, I didn&rsquo;t help him make this thing.  Call up the\nnorth pole if you can&rsquo;t figure it out.&rdquo;  (We were old enough at the time\nto know she was putting us on, but she can be very stubborn.  Her\nsense of humor is so dry, you never really know if she&rsquo;s joking, or\nhas had some break with reality and believes what she&rsquo;s saying.)</p>\n\n<p>Every year, whatever big present we got, it was at the end of a similar\ntreasure hunt.  It kept us out of our parents hair, that&rsquo;s for sure.  A\nchemistry set in the trunk of the car.  A Nintendo and a few games (that\nyear, my parents were eager for us to finish so that they could &ldquo;help&rdquo; play\nwith it.)  A &ldquo;treasure box&rdquo; filled with about $25 in quarters and dollar\nbills and some plastic pirate toys (not one of the fat years, but still fun.)\nOne year in highschool we had to drive across town to pick up one of the\nclues.  Once one of them was hidden in a file on a computer.  (And,\njust to throw us off, another clue that year was in a piece of paper\nliterally <em>inside</em> a different computer, so we had the thing mostly taken\napart to individual pieces before reading the clue more carefully.)</p>\n\n<p>Looking back, I attribute a lot of my relationship with my sister to the\nfact that my mother put so much time and thought\ninto getting us to work together and experience joy and frustration\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until recently that I learned that all this was a huge departure\nfrom the traditions in the Schlueter family, which previously had\ninvolved trekking back to my dad&rsquo;s home town (in <strong>South Dakota</strong> of all\nbloody places!)  Christmas eve gift exchange, followed by midnight mass,\nsleep, followed by <em>another</em> church service Christmas morning, and then a\nhuge elaborate dinner.  More Jesus than Santa.</p>\n\n<p>We did that one year.  I remember it sucking, and wishing that we could\njust do a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; christmas instead of all this work and church stuff,\nand driving across the country.  The food was ok, but I didn&rsquo;t see why I\nhad to put on dress pants and uncomfortable shoes to eat with my\ncousins.</p>\n\n<p>When I heard about other kids doing other\nthings, visiting family and such,\nI thought, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s kind of weird, I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have to do that.&rdquo;\nI didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortably different\nfor our &ldquo;easy&rdquo; traditions; they were <strong>great</strong>.

I didn&rsquo;t realize at the time, it wasn&rsquo;t just the\nwork, it was the <em>sense of obligation</em> she felt that made the work seem\nso awful sometimes.  She&rsquo;d grown up disliking christmas,\nand felt a tremendous pressure to make it magical for her kids.

            "content_raw": "<p>As an american, especially one descended from european catholics, there\nis no annual event as steeped in tradition and ritual as Christmas.  It\nseems at times that failing to maintain our traditions would be an\naffront to our ancestry, and a crime to our descendents.</p>\n\n<p>Tradition is a funny thing.  It\u2019s a social fiction.  It\u2019s something that\n<strong>we as humans decide we\u2019re going to do</strong>.  On the one hand, traditions\ncan give comfort and stability in the midst of a shifting world.  On the\nother hand, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve always done it this way\u201d is hardly an optimal\nheuristic for social behavior (or even good evidence for having in fact\nalways done it that way).</p>\n\n<p>Back when our software was being\nwritten, when our world changed less quickly, and tribal unity was a\nlife or death issue, it probably made a lot of sense to value stability\nover most other aspects of life.  However, in the modern world, the\nabsurdity of this pattern seems so painfully clear sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>Christmas just a few generations ago would have been <em>unrecognizable</em> to us\ntoday.  The \u201cSanta Claus\u201d character as we know him today, with the reindeer\nand flying and chimneys and north pole, was invented\nless than 200 years ago, and only became an overweight bearded red-clad man in\nthe 1920s.  Our \u201cclassic\u201d christmas songs were almost all written\nin the 1940s and 1950s.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A lot of our \u201ctime-honored\u201d christmas traditions were invented while\nmy parents were kids.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The christmas traditions that I remember were waking up early, opening\npresents, and then spending the day in pyjamas playing with new toys.\nNo travelling, no extended family, no huge dinner.  We didn\u2019t have any\nxmas eve celebration (probably because my parents did a lot of their\nshopping and preparation the night before.)  The \u201cchristmas dinner\u201d was\nusually delivery chinese.  Normal Rockwell would\u2019ve been scandalized.</p>\n\n<p>The extravagance of our christmas presents varied quite a lot.\nMy dad ran his own business, and along with that came a lot of\nups and downs.  When we didn\u2019t have a lot of money, my parents put\na lot of creativity into it.</p>\n\n<p>One year, our gifts consisted mainly of coupons to be redeemed for\noutings or favors at some later date.  We were young enough to be\nexcited about that.  Those coupons were made at home, printed\nto look official and then decorated with magic marker (our printer at\nthe time was a black and white dot-matrix.)</p>\n\n<p>The most awesome part of our xmas tradition came out of a creative\nsolution to a last-minute problem.  It was a good year, and my parents\nhad bought me\nand my sister new bicycles.  But, they didn\u2019t see any way to bring them\ninto the living room and wrap them in such a way that we wouldn\u2019t know\nright away what they were.</p>\n\n<p>They had the innovative idea to put the bikes outside in the shed,\nbut rather than just tell us to go out and get them, my mom designed a\ntreasure hunt that my sister and I would have to work together\nto solve.  The first clue was on a card buried in the middle of the\ntree.  That led to another clue, which led to another, and so on.  Each\none was a little puzzle that had to be solved, and it was all allegedly\nfrom \u201cSanta\u201d.  So, when we asked my mom for help, she just threw up her\nhands, and said, \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t help him make this thing.  Call up the\nnorth pole if you can\u2019t figure it out.\u201d  (We were old enough at the time\nto know she was putting us on, but she can be very stubborn.  Her\nsense of humor is so dry, you never really know if she\u2019s joking, or\nhas had some break with reality and believes what she\u2019s saying.)</p>\n\n<p>Every year, whatever big present we got, it was at the end of a similar\ntreasure hunt.  It kept us out of our parents hair, that\u2019s for sure.  A\nchemistry set in the trunk of the car.  A Nintendo and a few games (that\nyear, my parents were eager for us to finish so that they could \u201chelp\u201d play\nwith it.)  A \u201ctreasure box\u201d filled with about $25 in quarters and dollar\nbills and some plastic pirate toys (not one of the fat years, but still fun.)\nOne year in highschool we had to drive across town to pick up one of the\nclues.  Once one of them was hidden in a file on a computer.  (And,\njust to throw us off, another clue that year was in a piece of paper\nliterally <em>inside</em> a different computer, so we had the thing mostly taken\napart to individual pieces before reading the clue more carefully.)</p>\n\n<p>Looking back, I attribute a lot of my relationship with my sister to the\nfact that my mother put so much time and thought\ninto getting us to work together and experience joy and frustration\ntogether.</p>\n\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until recently that I learned that all this was a huge departure\nfrom the traditions in the Schlueter family, which previously had\ninvolved trekking back to my dad\u2019s home town (in <strong>South Dakota</strong> of all\nbloody places!)  Christmas eve gift exchange, followed by midnight mass,\nsleep, followed by <em>another</em> church service Christmas morning, and then a\nhuge elaborate dinner.  More Jesus than Santa.</p>\n\n<p>We did that one year.  I remember it sucking, and wishing that we could\njust do a \u201cnormal\u201d christmas instead of all this work and church stuff,\nand driving across the country.  The food was ok, but I didn\u2019t see why I\nhad to put on dress pants and uncomfortable shoes to eat with my\ncousins.</p>\n\n<p>When I heard about other kids doing other\nthings, visiting family and such,\nI thought, \u201cOh, that\u2019s kind of weird, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t feel uncomfortably different\nfor our \u201ceasy\u201d traditions; they were <strong>great</strong>.
