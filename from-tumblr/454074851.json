That\u2019s like $100/month for me (or more).  I thought for sure I\u2019d read something wrong.  I asked someone on their chat support if there was any way around this restriction, and was told that there wasn\u2019t.  \u201cIt\u2019s the way the software was designed,\u201d Mubarak said.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ok, fine,</em> I thought.  <em>I\u2019ll email support.  Surely someone will understand the lunacy of this policy, and agree to do business with me as the home user that I am.</em></p>\n\n<p>But here\u2019s the response I got:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>X-Mailer: Kayako SupportSuite v3.30.00<br>\n  X-Priority: 3<br>\n  MIME-Version: 1.0<br>\n  Date: Wed, 17 Mar 2010 01:43:26 -0600<br>\n  Message-ID: <a href=\"mailto:kzf1ge.31h66x@supportdesk.mozy.com\">kzf1ge.31h66x@supportdesk.mozy.com</a><br>\n  Subject: [MozyHome Windows Support #RNC-455427]: Mac Mini Server Support<br>\n  From: \u201cJudy Priyanka Asher\u201d <a href=\"mailto:support@mozy.com\">support@mozy.com</a><br>\n  Reply-To: support@mozy.com<br>\n  To: i@izs.me<br><br>\n  Hi Isaac,</p>\n  \n  <p>Thank you for contacting Mozy Technical Support.I would like to inform you\n  that only Mozy pro is compatiable with the Mac Mini Server, to access mozy\n  you need to purchase the Mozy pro account.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thanks\n  Judy\n  Mozy Support</p>\n  \n  <p>Ticket Details\n  Case ID: RNC-455427</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, I felt compelled to respond:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>MIME-Version: 1.0<br>\n  Sender: isaacschlueter@gmail.com<br>\n  Received: by 10.142.154.13 with HTTP; Wed, 17 Mar 2010 01:03:32 -0700 (PDT)<br>\n  In-Reply-To: <a href=\"mailto:kzf1ge.31h66x@supportdesk.mozy.com\">kzf1ge.31h66x@supportdesk.mozy.com</a><br>\n  References: <a href=\"mailto:kzf1ge.31h66x@supportdesk.mozy.com\">kzf1ge.31h66x@supportdesk.mozy.com</a><br>\n  Date: Wed, 17 Mar 2010 01:03:32 -0700<br>\n  Delivered-To: isaacschlueter@gmail.com<br>\n  X-Google-Sender-Auth: 06365dbeee9d860b<br>\n  Message-ID: <a href=\"mailto:aaedcef51003170103y184f669l3bf864e0ecf26275@mail.gmail.com\">aaedcef51003170103y184f669l3bf864e0ecf26275@mail.gmail.com</a><br>\n  Subject: Re: [MozyHome Windows Support #RNC-455427]: Mac Mini Server Support<br>\n  From: Isaac Schlueter <a href=\"mailto:i@izs.me\">i@izs.me</a><br>\n  To: support@mozy.com<br>\n  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8</p>\n  \n  <p>Judy,</p>\n  \n  <p>I want you to do me a favor.  Stop what you\u2019re doing for just a\n  moment, and think really hard about what your employer is doing.\n  Because it\u2019s really silly.  Like, you should laugh about it, probably.</p>\n  \n  <p>I could get a Mac Pro computer, put 8 giant hard disks in it, and\n  upload the entire library of congress to Mozy\u2019s servers for a hundred\n  bucks a year, but a Mac Mini with a single 500GB drive is going to\n  cost the outrageous sum of $0.50/GB/month (about $100/month in my\n  case) simply because the operating system has the word \u201cServer\u201d in the\n  title.</p>\n  \n  <p>If you were a good corporate citizen, you\u2019d probably do well to inform\n  the people who make decisions over there at Mozy that this is simply\n  boneheaded in all kinds of ways.  We\u2019re talking about a single-user\n  machine, which probably has less storage overhead than most of your\n  other MozyHomeUnlimited users.</p>\n  \n  <p>Yet, rather than do business with me, and host my modest single-user\n  backups, Mozy is setting the price more than TWELVE TIMES as high,\n  simply because of the <em>name</em> of another piece of software running on\n  the device.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sense: this makes none.  It\u2019s like McDonald\u2019s charging $800 for fries,\n  and demanding that you cannot have a burger without fries if you drive\n  a red car.  Seriously, it is exactly as insane as that.  I am shocked.</p>\n  \n  <p>Please refund my credit card purchase and cancel my account.  It\n  appears that Mozy is run by lunatics, and I simply cannot trust such\n  unhinged folks with my data.</p>\n  \n  <p>\u2013\n  Isaac Z. Schlueter</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t use Mozy.  They\u2019re fucking <em>crazy</em> over at that place.  And that\u2019s just not trustworthy.</p>",
