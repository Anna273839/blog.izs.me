If the leader is wrong about the facts on the ground (which <em>of course</em> they often will be, since they can&rsquo;t see it!), then this will lead to two types of disasters:</p>\n\n<ol><li>My leader is foolish, and I am enlightened (losing faith in the organization)</li>\n<li>My leader is enlightened, and I am foolish (losing faith in oneself)</li>\n</ol><p>Both of these are disasters because they break the &ldquo;intent out, reality in&rdquo; model.
