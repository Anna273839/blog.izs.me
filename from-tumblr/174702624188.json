I didn&rsquo;t know what exactly would be showing on the new channel, but I knew that a change was coming, and I wanted to make sure it&rsquo;d be good.  This idea of book marks was going to be my Pastry Box contribution.  I had thought it all out.</p>\n\n<p>I had no idea.</p>\n\n<p>On Christmas eve, I sat in a thai restaurant with my friend.  Luke, who makes jokes, and travels the world, and works on npm.  By the end of 2013 we hung out about weekly or more, to eat and chat and laugh.  We had met at Taco Conf a few years prior, where he told me that he wanted to move to Oakland to hang out with the Node people.  He did that.  We clicked well.  He watched my cats once.  I recommended him to Yahoo.</p>\n\n<p>The day before that dinner, Luke had written a note.  We complained about the holidays a bit, and shared Kao Nam Tod.  It didn&rsquo;t seem weird to me that he was in town.  After all, I was also.  I knew he was from upstate New York, but he didn&rsquo;t ever talk about his family there.  I don&rsquo;t know if I ever talked about my family much either.  Just never came up.  We reminisced about New England winters and how much nicer California is.  We talked about how horrible the holidays are, and about business and dating and the future.</p>\n\n<p>A few days later, I went out of town to visit family.  The trip was too long by a day.  At the end we were all eager to get back to our lives.  I came back on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.  I sent Luke a message the next morning, telling him that relatives had given me some cat toys, because they don&rsquo;t know how fat and lazy my cats are.  Maybe his kitten could attack them, instead of attacking his face, like it usually did.</p>\n\n<p>It was still early.  I figured he&rsquo;d get it when he got up.  I could bring them by.  I was working on npm\u00a0that day.  The new startup.  The Book Mark.  Everything was going great.  I was looking forward to telling him about the latest developments.</p>\n\n<p>I got a message from Luke at 4:15 in the afternoon.  Before seeing what it said, it reminded me that I hadn&rsquo;t had lunch yet, and hadn&rsquo;t seen him in a week, which was a perfect coincidence.  I was going to suggest Xolos.  His message asked, &ldquo;Could you share this publicly or privately in a few hours or so?&rdquo;  A link to the note that he wrote on Christmas Eve Eve.</p>\n\n<p>Oh no.  Wait.  Where are you, I&rsquo;m going there now.  I&rsquo;m coming to your house.  911.  Call Mikeal.  Call Dustin.  Tell Marisa to bring the car back home, we have to go, now.</p>\n\n<p>We met the police at his apartment.  The key was where he said it&rsquo;d be, and there was food and water for his kitten.  Calling, again and again, it rings 4 times, and then voicemail.  iMessages delivered, but no response.</p>\n\n<p>5:09, another buzz in my pocket.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve finally built up the courage to do it.  Thanks again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Calling.  Straight to voicemail.</p>\n\n<p>He said he&rsquo;d been hiding for years, that he was tired of pretending, tired of masking his pain.  It wasn&rsquo;t a statement, it was a choice, an expedient escape from his medical problem.</p>\n\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t know where he went.  Searched everything, everywhere.  Yahoo hired an investigator.  The police were beyond useless.  Clues pointed to a bridge, most likely the Golden Gate.  Coast Guard didn&rsquo;t have any John Does.</p>\n\n<p>He slipped through my fingers like smoke.  He&rsquo;d reached out to me.  I didn&rsquo;t save him.</p>\n\n<p>That week, I learned a lot about Luke&rsquo;s history, things he never told any of us.  I learned about his family, his past, his friends.  I talked to his mother and sisters.  Eyeballs deep in other people&rsquo;s shit, the unexpected executor of my friend&rsquo;s farewell.  I frantically invaded his privacy, tried to find anything that could give me some hope, some clue, some rock I could turn over that he&rsquo;d pop out from under.</p>\n\n<p>For a while some hoped that he was faking.  He&rsquo;d fled to Asia or Africa on some manic adventure, played a joke on all of us.  At 5:09 on New Year&rsquo;s Day, I lost my hope.  He wasn&rsquo;t joking.  Luke&rsquo;s jokes are funny, and clever, and often offensive.  His note was calm, resigned, touching.  If he had been crying for help, we would&rsquo;ve been able to help him.  He was smart.  He knew what he was doing.  He was doing it for himself, not for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>I waited for permission to grieve.  I told everyone else that we can&rsquo;t give up hope until they find a body.  But that was a lie, and I wasn&rsquo;t fooled.  I passed along <a href=\"http://blog.izs.me/post/72990767417/a-member-of-our-community-is-missing-help-find\">the flyers</a>, in a gesture of mourning.</p>\n\n<p>In December, I&rsquo;d hoped that this phase shift would be marked by the change of job roles, and in the fullness of time, maybe it will be.  But overlaid on that is the turbulent border between the part of my life where my friend Luke existed, and the part where he was abruptly and permanently gone.</p>",

Every line has been edited, every vision altered.</p>\n\n<p>This most recent shift, though\u2026 I saw this one coming.  Or at least, I saw one side of the book mark.</p>\n\n<p>I prepared the transition to be as smooth as possible.  I recruited allies, and trained a successor.  Now was the time.  I didn\u2019t know what exactly would be showing on the new channel, but I knew that a change was coming, and I wanted to make sure it\u2019d be good.  This idea of book marks was going to be my Pastry Box contribution.  I had thought it all out.</p>\n\n<p>I had no idea.</p>\n\n<p>On Christmas eve, I sat in a thai restaurant with my friend.  Luke, who makes jokes, and travels the world, and works on npm.  By the end of 2013 we hung out about weekly or more, to eat and chat and laugh.  We had met at Taco Conf a few years prior, where he told me that he wanted to move to Oakland to hang out with the Node people.  He did that.  We clicked well.  He watched my cats once.  I recommended him to Yahoo.</p>\n\n<p>The day before that dinner, Luke had written a note.  We complained about the holidays a bit, and shared Kao Nam Tod.  It didn\u2019t seem weird to me that he was in town.  After all, I was also.  I knew he was from upstate New York, but he didn\u2019t ever talk about his family there.  I don\u2019t know if I ever talked about my family much either.  Just never came up.  We reminisced about New England winters and how much nicer California is.  We talked about how horrible the holidays are, and about business and dating and the future.</p>\n\n<p>A few days later, I went out of town to visit family.  The trip was too long by a day.  At the end we were all eager to get back to our lives.  I came back on New Year\u2019s Eve.  I sent Luke a message the next morning, telling him that relatives had given me some cat toys, because they don\u2019t know how fat and lazy my cats are.  Maybe his kitten could attack them, instead of attacking his face, like it usually did.</p>\n\n<p>It was still early.  I figured he\u2019d get it when he got up.  I could bring them by.  I was working on npm\u00a0that day.  The new startup.  The Book Mark.  Everything was going great.  I was looking forward to telling him about the latest developments.</p>\n\n<p>I got a message from Luke at 4:15 in the afternoon.  Before seeing what it said, it reminded me that I hadn\u2019t had lunch yet, and hadn\u2019t seen him in a week, which was a perfect coincidence.  I was going to suggest Xolos.  His message asked, \u201cCould you share this publicly or privately in a few hours or so?\u201d  A link to the note that he wrote on Christmas Eve Eve.</p>\n\n<p>Oh no.  Wait.  Where are you, I\u2019m going there now.  I\u2019m coming to your house.  911.  Call Mikeal.  Call Dustin.  Tell Marisa to bring the car back home, we have to go, now.</p>\n\n<p>We met the police at his apartment.  The key was where he said it\u2019d be, and there was food and water for his kitten.  Calling, again and again, it rings 4 times, and then voicemail.  iMessages delivered, but no response.</p>\n\n<p>5:09, another buzz in my pocket.  \u201cI\u2019ve finally built up the courage to do it.  Thanks again.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Calling.  Straight to voicemail.</p>\n\n<p>He said he\u2019d been hiding for years, that he was tired of pretending, tired of masking his pain.  It wasn\u2019t a statement, it was a choice, an expedient escape from his medical problem.</p>\n\n<p>We didn\u2019t know where he went.  Searched everything, everywhere.  Yahoo hired an investigator.  The police were beyond useless.  Clues pointed to a bridge, most likely the Golden Gate.  Coast Guard didn\u2019t have any John Does.</p>\n\n<p>He slipped through my fingers like smoke.  He\u2019d reached out to me.  I didn\u2019t save him.</p>\n\n<p>That week, I learned a lot about Luke\u2019s history, things he never told any of us.  I learned about his family, his past, his friends.  I talked to his mother and sisters.  Eyeballs deep in other people\u2019s shit, the unexpected executor of my friend\u2019s farewell.  I frantically invaded his privacy, tried to find anything that could give me some hope, some clue, some rock I could turn over that he\u2019d pop out from under.</p>\n\n<p>For a while some hoped that he was faking.  He\u2019d fled to Asia or Africa on some manic adventure, played a joke on all of us.  At 5:09 on New Year\u2019s Day, I lost my hope.  He wasn\u2019t joking.  Luke\u2019s jokes are funny, and clever, and often offensive.  His note was calm, resigned, touching.  If he had been crying for help, we would\u2019ve been able to help him.  He was smart.  He knew what he was doing.  He was doing it for himself, not for anyone else.</p>\n\n<p>I waited for permission to grieve.  I told everyone else that we can\u2019t give up hope until they find a body.  But that was a lie, and I wasn\u2019t fooled.  I passed along <a href=\"http://blog.izs.me/post/72990767417/a-member-of-our-community-is-missing-help-find\">the flyers</a>, in a gesture of mourning.</p>\n\n<p>In December, I\u2019d hoped that this phase shift would be marked by the change of job roles, and in the fullness of time, maybe it will be.  But overlaid on that is the turbulent border between the part of my life where my friend Luke existed, and the part where he was abruptly and permanently gone.</p>",
