He&rsquo;s doing a talk at a school, and was curious about what we&rsquo;ve learned.  It struck me as a perfect idea for a blog post.</p>\n\n<p>Any other front-end professionals out there?

You can&rsquo;t just be the &ldquo;flash guy&rdquo; or the &ldquo;javascript guy&rdquo; or the &ldquo;css guy&rdquo; if you really want to go far in this discipline.  You can&rsquo;t look at a php bug and say &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a back-end issue,&rdquo; or look at an image that needs to be sliced up, and say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a design issue.&rdquo;  You need to be able to work in many different lands.  More and more, web applications are integrating many different technologies within the browser window.</p>\n\n<p>Learn everything.  Since you can&rsquo;t ever actually do that, learn as much as you can.  Learn how to learn quickly.  Eat, drink, and breathe css and javascript.

Fall in love with this field, and let it consume you.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the documentation out there is terrible.  Get used to it.  Chances are, the person who developed this-or-that thing was too busy to really explain how it works, or English is his second language, or he just never realized that someone else might find it useful.

Complaining helps no one.</p>\n\n<p>The specific tricks and languages that you learn in a typical computer science program are almost all useless in front-end engineering.  This is a cutting-edge discipline, and no school could ever hope to keep up with it.  Textbooks are usually written years ago, and every problem in them is already solved.  This field is all about finding and solving new problems that no one has ever thought of.  That sounds cool, but it&rsquo;s also a ton of work.  You need to be a little crazy to want this job.

Be strict in what you send, and accepting in what you receive, whether you&rsquo;re talking about requests over a network or manners in a meeting.  You don&rsquo;t know what constraints someone had to deal with when they built something.  The classic n00b mistake is to start out criticizing everyone, but that doesn&rsquo;t help anyone.  If you can do it better, do it; and then share it, discuss it, and document it.  You don&rsquo;t know the pressures that others are under, so be gentle when you tell them that something they want is impossible.</p>\n\n<p>Be ready to compromise, with yourself and with others.  The perfect system may take 10 days to create&mdash;you&rsquo;ll probably have 3.  Learn how to crunch and cut corners without sacrificing the quality of the end result.  Build quality up front, and fill in the details as you go.  Design your code in layers so that you&rsquo;ll have something worthwhile, even if you don&rsquo;t get to the end.  Know how to cut out unnecessary features, and be ruthless with the red pen when necessary.  Know how to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a request if it can&rsquo;t be done in time, even if you&rsquo;d really love to do it.
