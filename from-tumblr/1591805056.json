I repeated the confidence mantras in my head.  They\u2019re expendable workers.  I own this place.  I\u2019m the boss.  They work for me.  The only reason I don\u2019t fire them is that they\u2019re cheaper than robots.  Etc.</p>\n\n<p>I started talking to the family behind me as soon as I got into the security line, a middle-aged couple with 2 adolescent boys and a girl about 4 or 5.  They were amused by <a href=\"http://www.vibrams.co.uk/\">my shoes</a>, so it wasn\u2019t too hard to strike up a conversation.</p>\n\n<p>I asked where they were from.  Santa Clara.  Heading to Toronto for some family thing.  I asked if they\u2019d heard about the new X-Ray machines.  The dad was tired and apathetic. She said, \u201cOh, yeah, I heard about those on the news, that if you don\u2019t go through, they grope you or something, and if you do, they take a naked picture of you.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s messed up.  Did you know that the UCSF oncology department thinks they pose a serious health risk, especially to children or anyone at risk for breast cancer?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhoa, no, I didn\u2019t know that!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I handed the paper to the mom.  Bam.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cOh, honey, you should read this!! \u2026 Oh my god\u2026\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Turns out she\u2019s a breast cancer survivor.  And her doctor has told her to avoid x-rays, even at the dentist, unless absolutely medically necessary.  And she didn\u2019t realize that \u201cmillimeter wave digital backscatter detection\u201d used x-rays, because the TSA doesn\u2019t actually put that on the sign.</p>\n\n<p>She did the rest.</p>\n\n<p>When we got to the scanner, I opted out.  Then they opted out.  She\u2019d already convinced the family behind them to do the same.  Her response to the TSA agent was awesome, I wish I\u2019d thought of it:</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMa'am, please step over here.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNo thanks, I\u2019ve already had cancer, just feel me up or whatever.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>After the first 4 \u201cOPT-OUT\u201d calls, they just passed us all through the regular metal detector.  No one got groped.</p>\n\n<p>Information, properly delivered, is power.</p>\n\n<hr><p><em>Addendum</em> The revolt was emotionally satisfying, and I totally recommend doing it, but ultimately it\u2019s only a drop in the ocean.  From where I\u2019m sitting, I can see the security line, people holding their hands up in the little booth.</p>\n\n<p>So, do make trouble.  On-the-ground rebellion is important.  But also tell your legislator. There\u2019s a senate oversight meeting tomorrow, so please <a href=\"http://hillwho.com/index.php?option=com_sobi2&amp;sobi2Task=sobi2Details&amp;catid=10&amp;sobi2Id=5651\">call these people and tell them how you feel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll leave a voicemail.  It\u2019s easy and takes 2 seconds.  Just call up and say \u201cI think that the TSA has gone too far. Body scanning and inappropriate groping are unconstitutional and wrong. If you want my vote, change the policy.\u201d</p>\n\n<hr><p><em>Addendum 2</em> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeter_wave_scanner\">Millimeter wave scanners</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_X-ray\">Backscatter X-Rays</a> are not the same thing.  But it wasn\u2019t clear which one was in use, and the TSA sign used the terms interchangeably in the fine print where it told you about the opt-out option.</p>\n\n<p>Also, yes, it\u2019s true, the cancer risks are not well understood, and I absolutely committed the alarmist fallacy.  (\u201cBut can you really take that risk!\u201d)  Unfortunately, people aren\u2019t as afraid of a police state as they are of cancer.  I maintain that I used my powers for Good.</p>",
