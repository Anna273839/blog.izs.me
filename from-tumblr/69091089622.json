I asked a few of my teammates if they wanted to come\nwith me, and the answer was \u201cUm, no, I probably shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d  When I\nreturned, no fewer than 5 people asked me nervously if I was ok, if\nanything was wrong, where I went, what was going on.  It was SO weird.</p>\n\n<p>Something as simple as a sandwich wrapped in paper showed that I\nwasn\u2019t part of their unified tribe.  To make matters even worse, most\nengineers there were in the office around 7:30 in the morning, stayed\nfor the catered dinner (!!), worked another few hours, and then stuck\naround drinking beers in the office together until 23:00 or midnight.\nHaving bags under one\u2019s eyes was a mark of pride.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe I\u2019m just lazy, but I really only have about 5 solid hours of\nfocus in me on a given day, and those hours suffer considerably if I\ndon\u2019t get the proper physical, mental, and emotional rest.  So, it was\nnot a great fit.  I quit after a few months.  A year (and 2 pivots)\nlater, they were sold for a fraction of what their investors had put\nin, never having reached the general release of their product.</p>\n\n<p>But back to the lunches.  There\u2019s an important point there.</p>\n\n<p>Human societies function best when they are structured in such a way\nas to tolerate\u2013even <em>celebrate</em>\u2013disagreement.  If the society can be\n<em>improved</em> by disagreement, then that\u2019s even better.  It allows for\nfreedom, self-determination, experimentation, and a pervasive sense of\nsafety.  If you and I can disagree comfortably, then I don\u2019t have to\nworry that we might disagree, which means two things: I can be candid\nwith my honest opinions, and I can be open to yours.  I don\u2019t have to\nresist your opinions if I disagree, and I don\u2019t have to guess your\nreaction before I share mine.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, clearly some disagreements are <em>not</em> tolerable.  If you and\nI disagree about whether to put a knife in my chest, there\u2019s no way we\ncan both get our way.  Designing groups that can benefit from\ndisagreement is non-trivial, and usually happens by accident.  In the\npolitical space, this usually means some form of constitutional\ndemocracy, but neither \u201cconstitutional\u201d nor \u201cdemocracy\u201d will ensure a\nhealthy and inclusive culture or guarantee that experimentation will\nbe promoted.  Sometimes a limited dictator is safer than a powerful\nvoting bloc.</p>\n\n<p>With npm, I actively sought to design a software system in which we\ncould easily use one another\u2019s Node.js modules, without having to\nagree on which Node.js modules to use, or the best way to organize\nthem in our projects.</p>\n\n<p>I wish that I could claim credit for the \u201csmall modules\u201d design\nphilosophy or the many best practices and popular resources that have\nbeen created, but in truth, I can\u2019t.  All of those things were\ndesigned or discovered by other people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When everyone else is applying force, it\u2019s best to reduce\nfriction.</strong>  People were writing a lot of cool stuff, but having to\nagree on conventions and techniques was putting sand in the gears.\nThe downsides of ceremony and dependency hell are very difficult to\nappreciate ahead of time, and the choices that lead to that place\nsolve real problems early on.  With npm, I opted to <em>not</em> solve some\nproblems so that I <em>could</em> solve others.  By sticking to the rule of\n\u201cminimize the need for consensus\u201d, we\u2019ve found much more interesting\nproblems (like how to handle massive growth).</p>\n\n<p>The next time someone says that they like CoffeeScript, or that they\ndon\u2019t like Promises, or whatever other arbitrary preference you\nbelieve is \u201cwrong\u201d, instead of picking a fight with them, just be\nthankful that they\u2019re not the boss of you, and that you can like\ndifferent things, and still be friends.</p>",
