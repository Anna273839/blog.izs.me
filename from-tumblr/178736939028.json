Many of them are not what we might have thought of as \u201cNode Devs\u201d a few years ago (though many are).  Their websites run on every back-end platform, including but not limited to Node.js, and they all have to ship a website to browsers, which means JavaScript.

Time flies.)</em>  A fast-growing community means that most of the people writing websites, using Node.js-powered tooling and pulling libraries and frameworks from npm, <em>have only been doing it for less than 2 years</em>.  The split may have felt normal to those of us involved in 2009, but it seems unnatural and awkward to most working in the field today.  It\u2019s just JavaScript.  It runs on servers, and on the command line, and in browsers, and you use npm and a bunch of other tools it provides.  Is \u201cbabel\u201d a front-end tool or a back-end tool?  Why are there two groups, when it\u2019s mostly the same people?</p>\n\n<p>Node.js getting more integrated with the broader JS community means that the project can more effectively advocate for server-side use cases, and can get better feedback from those who are depending on Node.js to power the tools they use to ship websites.</p>\n\n<p>As one of the companies at the center of JavaScript development, we at npm are thrilled to see the two major JavaScript foundations joining forces to provide a forum for the entire Open Source JavaScript community.  Consistency of governance, processes, and policies can make it easier for devs in disparate JavaScript projects to collaborate and coordinate, removing an unnecessary barrier to innovation.  Both foundations now have an established history of iterating on their processes.  I hope that this new shift provides a chance to retrospect on what worked, what didn\u2019t work, and what can be improved by working together.</p>\n\n<p>On a personal note, I got involved with Node.js in the first place because I wanted to live in a world where front-end, back-end, tooling, and infrastructure coding did not require constantly shifting my brain around to a whole new language.  I couldn\u2019t have predicted how npm would become so relevant to the world of web development, and it\u2019s more than I would have thought to hope for.  There\u2019s a lot of open questions about what exactly a merged foundation will look like, but I\u2019m very happy to see things move in this direction.</p>\n</blockquote>",
