That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s always been an \u201copening\nparty\u201d rather than a \u201cspeakers dinner\u201d; <em>all</em> the attendees hang out\ntogether, there is no \u201cspeakers lounge\u201d.  Yes, there are celebrities\nin any community, the visible people who are highly engaged with the\ncore technology and help keep the wheels turning.  But the entire\ncommunity feels unwelcoming and strange when those people are treated\nas a separate class of untouchables.  We&rsquo;re all just humans.</p>\n\n<p>Nowhere is this more apparent than at Walker Creek Ranch.  This was my\nthird time at the place in as many years.  The last two years,\nMikeal&rsquo;s arranged a NodeConf Summer Camp there, which was like a\nscaled down unconference-style meeting of people who came and\ndiscussed where the core of Node would go next.  Without much of an\nagenda, it was very free-form, and the comfortable setting allowed for\nsome intense debates about stuff ranging from putting zlib in core, to\ndomains, to the needs of our Stream interface, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Walker Creek Range is magical.  In the woods, we&rsquo;re all animals.\nWe&rsquo;re all of the same tribe, all on the same team.  When you jump in a\nlake with someone, or sit under a tree, or make smores by a campfire,\nyou are bonded in a way that email and IRC can never achieve.  There\nare no podiums or stages.  You don&rsquo;t need to save your seat or worry\nabout someone running off with your bag (where would they go?)</p>\n\n<p>When Mikeal said he was going to just do a single conference this\nyear, instead of a traditional NodeConf and then a separate NodeConf\nSummer Camp, and that it&rsquo;d be at Walker Creek Ranch, I told him it was\na great idea.  When he told me that I&rsquo;d have to teach the same class 8\ntimes, I winced.  I told him, \u201cSure.  I&rsquo;ll do that.  I don&rsquo;t think\nyou&rsquo;ll find 7 other people who will, though.\u201d  That is because I can be cynical.</p>\n\n<p>Time and again, this community surprises me, and Mikeal surprises me.\nNot only did he find plenty of people to staff all the 8 sessions, he\nsomehow managed to trick everyone into actually attending every\nsession, even though I&rsquo;m sure many of them came in thinking that most\nof these sessions would be way over their heads.</p>\n\n<p>So, enough gushing.

When you jump in a\nlake with someone, or sit under a tree, or make smores by a campfire,\nyou are bonded in a way that email and IRC can never achieve.  There\nare no podiums or stages.  You don\u2019t need to save your seat or worry\nabout someone running off with your bag (where would they go?)</p>\n\n<p>When Mikeal said he was going to just do a single conference this\nyear, instead of a traditional NodeConf and then a separate NodeConf\nSummer Camp, and that it\u2019d be at Walker Creek Ranch, I told him it was\na great idea.  When he told me that I\u2019d have to teach the same class 8\ntimes, I winced.  I told him, \u201cSure.  I\u2019ll do that.  I don\u2019t think\nyou\u2019ll find 7 other people who will, though.\u201d  That is because I can be cynical.</p>\n\n<p>Time and again, this community surprises me, and Mikeal surprises me.\nNot only did he find plenty of people to staff all the 8 sessions, he\nsomehow managed to trick everyone into actually attending every\nsession, even though I\u2019m sure many of them came in thinking that most\nof these sessions would be way over their heads.</p>\n\n<p>So, enough gushing.  Here\u2019s what was in the How To Node Core session\nthat I led with Bert Belder, who was a tremendous help.</p>\n\n<h2>How To Node Core</h2>\n\n<p>As people walked in, it\u2019s important to remember that they usually had\nno idea what session \u201c6\u201d was going to be.  Also, because the schedules\nwere randomized, they weren\u2019t seeing the same people that they\u2019d met\nin their previous sessions.  Strangers!  Surprises!  Oh no!</p>\n\n<p>When they saw me and Bert in there, and the first slide up on the\nprojector, a few people took a noticeable gulp, like they accidentally\nsigned up for Calc 3, but should have been in Algebra 1.  <strong>This is\nexactly the reaction that we were hoping for.</strong>  The <em>point</em> of\nNodeConf this year, the goal, was to expose people, in an accessible\nhands-on way, to something that they never would have thought that\nthey could do.</p>\n\n<p>(Of course, a few people saw which session it was, and were not\nfazed, since a bunch of people at the conference had already landed\npull requests before.)</p>\n\n<p>Here are the slides:</p>\n\n<div><iframe src=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/23878251\" width=\"427\" height=\"356\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid\n#CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe> </div>\n\n<p>The first thing we did was make sure that everyone had the Node.js\nsource code checked out, and could build it.  Typically there were 3\nor 4 people who needed help getting to this step, and Bert would run\naround for the first few minutes with USB sticks getting people up and\nrunning.</p>\n\n<p>A few people noticed the \u201cnodeconf2013\u201d branch in the github repo\nalready, so they had all the examples and source code already written.</p>\n\n<p>When I got to the \u201cexample\u201d portions in the slides, I\u2019d stop and do\nthe Substack-style <code>vim *.*</code> and then use <code>:next</code> and <code>:prev</code> to move\nbetween files.</p>\n\n<p>The first example was <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/isaacs/5938171\">this</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The second was <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/isaacs/5938207\">this</a>.  For\nmany people at the conference, this was their first ever experience\nediting a C++ file, and compiling the program with their changes.</p>\n\n<p>And <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/isaacs/5938185\">here</a> are the diffs for\nthe exercise.  Not everyone finished it, and many probably implemented\nit somewhat differently, but the exploration was the point of the\nwork, not the destination.</p>\n\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n\n<p>The results were very encouraging.  A lot of people mentioned that\nthey\u2019d alwasy felt like Node Core is this really intimidating thing,\nand never even bothered to look under the hood to see how it was all\nwired together.  They were genuinely surprised to find out that Node\u2019s\ninternal modules are very much like a plain old Node program, with\n<code>require()</code> and everything.</p>\n\n<p>Also, ironically, I found that when I went <em>faster</em>, there were\n<em>fewer</em> people who fell behind.  I don\u2019t know if the energy of the\nspeaker makes them feel more motivated, or if the fear of being left\nbehind makes them pay more attention, or what.  But when I slowed down\nto let people catch up, they fell behind worse, which surprised me.</p>\n\n<p>If you ever want to run an event like this, the value of having another set of hands there really cannot be overstated.  Without Bert running around to keep people following along, it never would have went as smoothly as it did.  I did most of the talking, but he was absolutely essential.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I think we had a big effect on many peoples\u2019 level of\nintimidation about contributing to Node core.  The first step is to\nrealize that you can do it, so it\u2019s worth trying.</p>",
