> Coming up as a software developer in Open Source, I’ve long believed
> that the best path to success is to depend on the strengths of others.
> One reason why I wrote a package manager in the first place was that I
> knew the JavaScript community as a whole could write a much better web
> platform than any one team or developer, if only we could reduce the
> friction in the collaboration process. I wanted that platform to
> exist, and frankly, had no idea it would turn out as wonderfully as it
> has.
> 
> When I founded npm, Inc. back in 2014, one piece of advice I got as a
> founding CEO of a startup was: start planning your transition (lest it
> be planned for you). I took that advice to heart, and throughout the
> life of this company, I have tried to avoid holding any illusions
> about my own abilities. After spending 8 years running npm – first as
> an independent project leader, then as a founding CEO – I learned my
> share of lessons about where my skills lie and where I fall short.
> 
> I have a passion for developing products that streamline the
> experience of creating software applications and sharing libraries.
> npm’s place in the development ecosystem speaks to some considerable
> skill in that area. I don’t have as much of a passion for running go
> to market efforts, hammering out the details of partnerships, business
> and HR operations, or managing a large team of employees.
> 
> These are interesting challenges, to be sure, and I adore this group
> of humans who have joined the company and added so much to npm. But it
> became increasingly clear that npm, Inc. needed new leadership if the
> company was going to make good on the promise of providing financial
> support for this cultural movement. I found that any attention I spent
> on anything other than product meant that the company suffered, and so
> did my soul.
> 
> It turns out hiring a CEO is hard! We spent 6 months on our first
> search, and the outcome was that the company was just not ready.
> Several extremely smart and capable people came in and said, “Yeah,
> you’ve probably got something here, but it’s not far enough along to
> hire someone like me.” So, we regrouped, reevaluated our strategy for
> our enterprise product line, [acquired a security
> company](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/172793182214/npm-acquires-lift-security-and-node-security),
> and came up with a better vision for the company’s future. Our second
> search had a much better result, with one candidate standing out,
> being both a good fit for the company and also eager to take on the
> challenges ahead.
> 
> Today, I’m happy to introduce Bryan Bogensberger as npm, Inc.’s CEO.
> He brings a wealth of experience in Open Source and a ton of
> excitement and expertise to help grow npm to the next level and
> beyond. Commercializing something like this without ruining it is no
> small task, and building the team to deliver on npm’s promise is a
> major undertaking. We’ve sketched out a business plan and strategy for
> the next year, and will be announcing some other key additions to the
> team in the coming months.
> 
> Meanwhile, I’ve taken on the title of Chief Product Officer and I will
> be spending my time focused on the part of the problem that I love.
> 
> I’m extremely excited about what 2019 will bring for npm, Inc. and the
> growing community we serve. If your company uses npm (spoiler alert:
> they do), and you’d like to see how you can professionalize your
> JavaScript story, check out [npm
> Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise) and [npm
> Orgs](https://www.npmjs.com/orgs). If you’d like to be a part of the
> company that’s continuing to improve how JavaScript is done around the
> world, [come work here](https://www.npmjs.com/jobs).
