<h2><b>Unarmed Black Man With Hands Up Shot By Police.</b></h2>
<p><b>Charles Kinsey, 47, a behavior therapist from South Florida was shot in the leg three times by the police in North Miami while laying on the ground with his arms up and trying to help his patient with autism who had run away from a group home.</b></p>
<p>It all started when someone called 911 and said there was a man walking around with a gun. However it was Kinsey’s patient who was sitting on the ground cross-legged, playing with a toy truck.</p>
<h2>Charles got shot by police despite telling them he was only trying to help his patient.</h2>
<p><b>The police shot him, handcuffed him and left him on ground bleeding.</b></p>
<p>North Miami police have not released much information at
all. They haven’t released the officer’s name, they haven’t given us an update
on the investigation. However, they did say that the state attorney is now a part of
this investigation.</p>
