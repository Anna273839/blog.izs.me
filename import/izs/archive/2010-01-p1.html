<h2>Hours of Sleep</h2>
<p>Seldo: That doesn't really work for me as I naturally wake up every few hours<br>
Seldo: I need a clock to tell me if another 2-hour cycle is safe<br>
Isaac: crazy<br>
Seldo: Because waking up halfway through a cycle breaks me for the whole day<br>
Isaac: how are you not complete manic and anxious and crazy all the time?<br>
Seldo: Have you met me?<br>
Isaac: oh yeah, huh...</p>

<h2>Shared Flashback</h2>
<p>Some time around That 70&rsquo;s Show, maybe earlier, but certainly post-Seinfeld, characters in sitcoms gained the ability to have a shared flashback to instantly and graphically communicate with one another.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s really odd is that they often know they can do this, and even make meta-jokes about this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Is there a word for this?  It seems to me to be something unique to the television storytelling medium, and fairly recent, and we all seem to Just Get It.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s neat.</p>

<h2>Transition</h2>
<p>My last day at Yahoo will be 2010-01-22.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten an offer from <a href="http://proofpoint.com/">Proofpoint</a> which is too good to ignore.  The opportunity to drive the direction of a product at an early stage, including having a lot of input about the choice of technology and team, is very exciting.  Also, though this was not the primary factor, the position is significantly more financially rewarding than I believe that the next few years would be if I stayed at Yahoo.</p>

<p>Yahoo has been a mostly great company to work for, and <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a> is by far the best team that I&rsquo;ve worked on here.  It&rsquo;s a shame that I didn&rsquo;t join YUI sooner; I still feel like I just got here.  The quality of this team made the decision very difficult, and that says a lot about the job that Eric Miraglia and Thomas Sha have done building it.</p>

<p>If you ever get a chance to work at Yahoo, take it.</p>

<p>I feel so very fortunate to have met so many of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s bright minds in the last 4 years, and to have learned so much about the web, about business, about people, and about the science and art of software development.  I&rsquo;ve been a student, a teacher, an expert, an amateur, a mentor, and a mentee.</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for what you&rsquo;ve given me.</p>
