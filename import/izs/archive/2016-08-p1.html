<h2>Someone emailed me asking for tips or sites for learning JavaScript, and this is my final answer.</h2>
<p>Warning, this is going to seem like &ldquo;I believe I did, Bob&rdquo;-style advice (ref: <a href="http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/">http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/nosql/</a>)</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s really not.  I really mean this, really and truly, from the bottom of my heart, as actual advice that I firmly believe will help people more efficiently and thoroughly than any other approach to learning JavaScript.  My advice is this:</p>

<p><strong>Read the ECMAScript specification.</strong></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t feel like you have to understand every word.  Give yourself permission to just force the words into your brain, and move on to the next section.  If you&rsquo;re diligent about it, it only takes a few hours.  Repeat this process every few years.</p>

<p>I guarantee it will be an unpleasant experience if you&rsquo;re not already experienced with reading language specifications.  (As they go, this is a pretty good one, I&rsquo;ve since learned.)  It&rsquo;s not fun reading.  And it&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;ll be able to sit down and suddenly grok the whole language like seeing the matrix or anything.</p>

<p>But I can also pretty much guarantee that you&rsquo;ll be surprised what sticks.  Weeks or months or years later, you&rsquo;ll encounter some weird bug, or read a blog post, and go &ldquo;OH!  So THAT&rsquo;S what that was talking about!  Where was that?  The part on function contexts or something?&rdquo; and then you&rsquo;ll be prepared to go look it up and get the exact details.</p>

<p>If you already know a bit of JavaScript, then reading the spec will be a bit less unpleasant, but parts will seem like you can skip them.  <strong>Don&rsquo;t skip those parts.</strong></p>

<p>Programming requires a certain kind of precision, and a specification is a very precise thing.  It&rsquo;s tempting to think that learning must also follow a kind of precision, where you fully grok each concept before learning the next one, and follow a proper ordering of things.</p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing: humans aren&rsquo;t precise.  Learning is not like putting data into a computer because we aren&rsquo;t computers and understanding isn&rsquo;t information to be tokenized and stored.  Understanding is more like a muscle than a memory, and learning is more like digestion than data entry.  Let&rsquo;s none of us be confused that digestion is anything but a process of turning nutrients into some combination of more you, mostly-wasted energy, and shit, and it&rsquo;s not even remotely precise or ordered.  And a language spec is like boiled kale with no salt, but it&rsquo;s packed with nutritive understanding that will mostly be shat out of your brain or wasted in pointless hacker news threads, but some small part of it will make you strong and healthy.</p>

<p>So if you want to grow in the JavaScripts, you&rsquo;ll never get there with candy-coated tutorials.  Eat your fucking vegetables, and read the spec.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>

<h2>Plop the Frog</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a frog, who had no name, but we&rsquo;ll call
Plop.  Plop hopped along as best he could. However, Plop had a few
extra legs, which didn&rsquo;t work so well. Environmental activists, tall
bald chimps of the sort that builds factories and complains about
factories, thought it was because of pollution from the factories.
But actually, it was a parasite that entered Plop&rsquo;s egg and lived in
Plop while he was a tadpole, eventually altering his development
during metamorphosis.</p>

<p>Eventually, since Plop couldn&rsquo;t hop like his fellow frogs, he was
eaten by a snake, and Plop&rsquo;s parasite infected the snake&rsquo;s intestine,
where it would reproduce, and create offspring to make other frogs hop
like Plop.  (A snail was also involved, but this story is already more
than complicated enough.)</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that nature is fascinating in its utter and
complete lack of empathy.  Evolution doesn&rsquo;t give any fucks about
anyone.  Genes do whatever they have to do to get ahead, even if it
means ruining the lives of frogs like Plop, and sending them through
an agonizing existence into an early grave in the belly of a snake.</p>

<p>Factories are bad for lots of reasons.  But the opposite of bad isn&rsquo;t
good, and &ldquo;natural&rdquo; is not a synonym for &ldquo;healthy&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing. We’ve given up on style. We can’t keep up. We have too many kids and not enough time, and when we go out on a weekend day to do a bunch of stuff, we need pockets. We need them for wallets and dolls and water bottles and an extra pull-up, maybe a sippy cup or a phone or two. We aren’t concerned about whether you like them. We are trying to get through this phase of our lives, which, quite frankly, requires more pocket space than we ever expected. Let us live. CRGO 4 LYF.</p>
