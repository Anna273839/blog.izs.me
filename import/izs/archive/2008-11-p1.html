<h2>How Not to Get Real (and die trying)</h2>
<p>Recently, Auston of the <a href="http://getrealordie.com/"><del datetime="2008-11-12T16:30:10+00:00">Dashboard</del> Leadlog startup</a> in Florida posted a <a href="http://getrealordie.com/?p=12">somewhat snarky</a> blog post about one of the responses to a <a href="http://www.krop.com/jobs/n6ky3/">job opening at their company</a>.  I more or less said the same things that appeared <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=360574">on Hacker News</a>.  Eventually my comment may show up, but it&rsquo;s <a href="http://getrealordie.com/?p=12#comment-20">buried at #20</a>, so I thought I&rsquo;d post it here, as well.</p>

<p>Auston, this is for you.</p>

<hr><p>While his tone was a little condescending, I completely see where this person was coming from.  I have all of these skills, and if I was on the market, I&rsquo;d skip right over your ad.  I wouldn&rsquo;t even consider it, and I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be kind enough to tell you why.  If anything, he wasn&rsquo;t harsh enough, and you&rsquo;d be wise to find the grain of truth in his criticism.</p>

<p>Money isn&rsquo;t just important as a way to pay the bills.  I could pay my bills on a lot less than I make today.  Money is important because it shows how much an employer values me and my skills, which is also an indication of the work environment.  Moreover, labor is a market.  I&rsquo;m not even going to consider an employer who can&rsquo;t pay what the market will bear.  Put another way, why would I want to work for anyone other than the employer who values me the most?</p>

<p>When you hire someone, however you&rsquo;re compensating them, <strong>it&rsquo;s more than they could get anywhere else</strong>.  Think about that for a moment.  If you get a Porche at a Honda price, don&rsquo;t be surprised if the motor doesn&rsquo;t live up to the salesman&rsquo;s promises.  You offered the highest price he could get for it, and it wasn&rsquo;t a very good price.  Maybe the other buyers know something you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Of course, salary isn&rsquo;t the only kind of compensation.  If they really believe in your company, they&rsquo;ll push for equity, because they&rsquo;ll believe that the equity is more valuable than the paycheck.  If that&rsquo;s the kind of belief you want, then you need to structure the compensation to be competitive to people who feel that way.</p>

<p>Your ad describes an expert frontend/backend guru-level ops/designer/architect (who also doesn&rsquo;t mind slogging through maintenance tasks).  And to compensate them, you&rsquo;re offering&hellip;. a big monitor? Ping pong? JOKES!? Are you SERIOUS?  Talking about a &ldquo;comfortable and fun work environment&rdquo; is a red flag.  If you have to go out of your way to keep your engineers entertained and comfortable, that usually means that your product very boring and unpleasant.  No thanks.</p>

<p>It sounds like you want a CTO or chief architect.  If you can&rsquo;t afford several hundred thousand per year in salary (which most startups can&rsquo;t), you&rsquo;d better be prepared to hand over a sizable chunk of your company to them.  Skip the stuff about your killer break rooms, they probably have better chairs and toys at home.  Sell them on the concept and the business plan instead.  Anyone with those skills knows what they&rsquo;re worth.  You&rsquo;re recruiting a partner, not an employee, but your ad clearly shows that you don&rsquo;t get that.</p>

<p>If you balk at giving up so much, then ask yourself this: why else would someone with with that value choose to invest it in YOU, when they can do half the work and make 4 times as much at Google or Yahoo, or probably start their own company and compete with you directly?  You&rsquo;re hunting tigers, and frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like you&rsquo;re up to the task.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> that level of expertise, then don&rsquo;t <em>ask</em> for it.  When you want a Honda, and you can afford a Honda, you go to a Honda dealership.  Job ads are not the place to shoot for stretch goals.  This is the equivalent of the resumes that list every buzzword under the sun, when the person has real experience in maybe two or three.</p>

<blockquote>We&rsquo;re two biz dev guys, a ux guru and a hacker with solid business experience.</blockquote>

<p>So, you&rsquo;re 4 people, and only one of you writes code?  Good luck with that.  No wonder you need so much help.  One of the biz dev guys should probably sell their equity to the other three, and go &ldquo;dev&rdquo; some other &ldquo;biz&rdquo;.  Then maybe you&rsquo;d be able to afford the CTO you need.  It&rsquo;s going to be a tough sell, though, given the childish attitude towards compensation.</p>

<h2>My Letter to Obama</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit off-topic for this blog, but it&rsquo;s important.</p>

<p>Please head over to <a href="http://change.gov/page/s/yourstory">Obama&rsquo;s website</a> and let the new administration know what you expect from your government.</p>

<p>This is the letter I just sent.</p>

<blockquote>Mr. President Elect Barack Obama,

We spend far too much money on policing the world with a network of bases.  Our military empire is a liability.  We can&rsquo;t afford it.  It doesn&rsquo;t actually make America safer.  It provides a way for crooked individuals to bilk the American taxpayer out of billions of dollars through anti-competitive contracts.

America could cut its military spending by a very significant amount, and still remain an overwhelmingly powerful world leader.  Our economy cannot support the expense of tyranny, especially if you are going to actually accomplish half of what you&rsquo;ve promised.

The cold war is over.  The worst ever foreign attack on American civilians was orchestrated with airplanes and box cutters.  Wars of the future will be won and lost through diplomacy and intelligence, and those can be had at a relative bargain.  An arms race is a fruitless waste of money, paid for by the sweat and time of the people who have given you a clear mandate to improve their lives.

What&rsquo;s worse, our military empire is perversely un-American.  The nation that once ran the banner of &ldquo;no taxation without representation&rdquo; is now using its military weight to enforce policy on nations whose citizens do not get a representative in the American congress, a vote in our elections, or the protection of the Bill of Rights.  Even if it seems expedient at times, oppression never ultimately furthers the American agenda.  It alienates and disenfranchises the very people whose help we most need in future conflicts.

Please put an end to this outdated, immoral, and expensive offense against humans everywhere.  We&rsquo;ve hired you to change things.  Please change this.</blockquote>

<h2>The Haiku OOO Email</h2>
<p>When I started at Yahoo on the <a href="http://games.yahoo.com/">Games</a> team, there was a custom that resonated deeply with me, which was started by Dean Yu.</p>

<p>All &ldquo;work from home&rdquo; emails or &ldquo;out of office&rdquo; emails had to be sent in the form of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">haiku</a>.  This rule was not enforced, but it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that one person does, and then a few others pick up.  Once someone starts doing it, they rarely stop.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>Sick on an airplane.
Second carry-on: virus.
Infect passengers.</pre>

<pre>OS API:
Sadly, not writing itself.
Avoid distractions.</pre>

<pre>Roommate needs his car.
Internet works in new place.
May as well use it!</pre>

<pre>Nothing in iCal:
Must take advantage of this.
Work in pajamas.</pre>

<pre>Still not feeling well
Resting and working from home
Please ping or call me</pre>

<pre>Have suffered relapse
To this weekend's brief illness
So I work from home</pre>

<pre>Sneezing mightily
Wish not to infect colleagues
Thus working from home</pre>

<p>A couplet for my recent vacation:</p>

<pre>Been a busy year.
No vacations since ’06
Burnt out: Do not want.

Visit with old friends.
New England trees in autumn.
Rejuvenation.</pre>

<p>Having worked on a bunch of teams, I&rsquo;ve taken this custom with me as much as possible, to the Brand Universe team, and the Buzz team, and most recently the YAP team.  There&rsquo;s no proselytizing involved.  I just send a haiku I&rsquo;m working from home.  Some people think it&rsquo;s fun, and play a round of &ldquo;speaking in poetry&rdquo; via email.  Some people adopt the custom, and it sticks.  Others, for whatever reason, never get involved.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why some seem to instinctively carry it on, and others instead prefer just the subject of &ldquo;wfh&rdquo; or &ldquo;ooo&rdquo; with no message body.  I&rsquo;ve been told that there are other teams at Yahoo and elsewhere that this custom has spread.  In Games, it&rsquo;s all but gone, now that Dean has moved on.</p>

<p>Like the Twitter of the Edo Period, haiku (then called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikai">haikai</a>) used terse imagery to elevate the normal and mundane to the deep and meaningful.</p>

<p>Most people learn in grade school that a haiku is 3 lines, with syllables numbering 5/7/5.  While this is the typical standard, it&rsquo;s not just about fitting into the right number of syllables.</p>

<p>The goal of haiku is to find powerful expression in a small intense dose, to elicit an &ldquo;AH HA!&rdquo; experience by virtue of succinctly expressing meaning via simple language and powerful imagery.</p>

<p>Limitation—whether 5/7/5 or 140 characters—is part of the equation.  Because the limits are so draconian, the writer is forced to be clear.  <strong>Squeezing ideas into uncomfortably small packages shaves off the excess.</strong>  When the excess is removed, enlightenment remains.</p>

<p>Like Twitter, haiku can be terribly inane and useless.  That is bad haiku.  Truth be told, most WFH emails basically are expressing a single sentiment, and the form adds little to the composition.  It&rsquo;s just fun.</p>

<p>Good programming is like good poetry.  The best programmers I&rsquo;ve known are obsessively minimalist in their code, and do tremendously powerful things with simple logic and short functions.  The same can be said for all levels of design: a simple business model, a straightforward user flow, a clean visual treatment.</p>

<p>Less is more.  Like the kendō master who practices calligraphy, or the actor who studies yoga, the pursuit of excellence in one area can balance and ready the mind for one&rsquo;s primary activity.</p>

<p>The next time you have to send an email to your team telling them that you&rsquo;ll be out of the office for some reason, put it in the form of a haiku.  Don&rsquo;t explain it or call attention to it.  It will be your gift.  Watch how it is received.</p>

<p class="small">In case you&rsquo;ve never hit them organically: <a href="http://foohack.com/error/missing.html">404</a> <a href="http://foohack.com/error/authorization.html">401</a> <a href="http://foohack.com/error/forbidden.html">403</a> <a href="http://foohack.com/error/gone.html">410</a></p>
