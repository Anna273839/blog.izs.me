<h2>MozyHomeUnlimited - Not for OS X Server</h2>
<p>When I got the error message telling me I needed to upgrade to Mozy Pro, I was a little annoyed.  I figured that I&rsquo;d have to shell out $200/year instead of $100/year or something.  <em>Oh, well.  Still a good deal, I guess.</em></p>

<p>Then I saw the price.</p>

<p>$3.95/month (ok&hellip;) and $0.50/GB (WTF!?)</p>

<p>50 cents per GB.  Per month.  That&rsquo;s like $100/month for me (or more).  I thought for sure I&rsquo;d read something wrong.  I asked someone on their chat support if there was any way around this restriction, and was told that there wasn&rsquo;t.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way the software was designed,&rdquo; Mubarak said.</p>

<p><em>Ok, fine,</em> I thought.  <em>I&rsquo;ll email support.  Surely someone will understand the lunacy of this policy, and agree to do business with me as the home user that I am.</em></p>

<p>But here&rsquo;s the response I got:</p>

  <p>Judy,</p>
  
  <p>I want you to do me a favor.  Stop what you&rsquo;re doing for just a
  moment, and think really hard about what your employer is doing.
  Because it&rsquo;s really silly.  Like, you should laugh about it, probably.</p>
  
  <p>I could get a Mac Pro computer, put 8 giant hard disks in it, and
  upload the entire library of congress to Mozy&rsquo;s servers for a hundred
  bucks a year, but a Mac Mini with a single 500GB drive is going to
  cost the outrageous sum of $0.50/GB/month (about $100/month in my
  case) simply because the operating system has the word &ldquo;Server&rdquo; in the
  title.</p>
  
  <p>If you were a good corporate citizen, you&rsquo;d probably do well to inform
  the people who make decisions over there at Mozy that this is simply
  boneheaded in all kinds of ways.  We&rsquo;re talking about a single-user
  machine, which probably has less storage overhead than most of your
  other MozyHomeUnlimited users.</p>
  
  <p>Yet, rather than do business with me, and host my modest single-user
  backups, Mozy is setting the price more than TWELVE TIMES as high,
  simply because of the <em>name</em> of another piece of software running on
  the device.</p>
  
  <p>Sense: this makes none.  It&rsquo;s like McDonald&rsquo;s charging $800 for fries,
  and demanding that you cannot have a burger without fries if you drive
  a red car.  Seriously, it is exactly as insane as that.  I am shocked.</p>
  
  <p>Please refund my credit card purchase and cancel my account.  It
  appears that Mozy is run by lunatics, and I simply cannot trust such
  unhinged folks with my data.</p>
  
  <p>&ndash;
  Isaac Z. Schlueter</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t use Mozy.  They&rsquo;re fucking <em>crazy</em> over at that place.  And that&rsquo;s just not trustworthy.</p>
