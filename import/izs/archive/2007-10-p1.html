<h2>Required reading for web developers: The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand</h2>
<p>I was thinking recently about one of my favorite books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452286751/?tag=isaacschlcom-20">The Fountainhead</a> by Ayn Rand, and how relevant it is to the topic of web development.  Yahoo&rsquo;s internal web developer mailing list flares up in these delightful debates once or twice a month, and it always warms my heart to be reminded that there&rsquo;s an intransigent little Roark inside each one of us.  Some 50 years before the Internet was even a spark in <a title="Tim Berners-Lee" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">TBL</a>&rsquo;s eye, Ayn Rand managed to capture the timeless essence of a web developer in the character of Howard Roark.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452286751/?tag=isaacschlcom-20"><img src="http://myskitch.com/isaacschlueter/the-fountainhead-20071026-142719.jpg" alt="The Fountainhead" height="400" width="272" class="alignright"/></a> Don&rsquo;t worry, this isn&rsquo;t going to be a post about philosophy or capitalism or &ldquo;Man&rsquo;s life <i lang="latin">qua</i> Man&rdquo; or any of that.  If that&rsquo;s the Ayn Rand you want, maybe you should check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452011876/?tag=isaacschlcom-20">Atlas Shrugged</a>.  There&rsquo;s a bit of that in The Fountainhead, too, but what struck me most deeply about it is the way that it deals with the internal passion that seems to accompany the creative/technical blend in fields like ours.</p>

<p>From Chapter 1&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>Here are my rules: what can be done with one substance must never be done with another. No two materials are alike. No two sites on earth are alike. No two buildings have the same purpose. The purpose, the site, the material determine the shape. Nothing can be reasonable or beautiful unless its made by one central idea, and the idea sets every detail. A building is alive, like a man.</blockquote>

<p>Some sites are best built with a few static HTML files.  Others are better served by a database-driven PHP pages and links between them.  Still others are best served by a lot of Ajax and a single URL.  No web site can be reasonable or beautiful unless it is made by one central idea, and the idea sets every detail.  Every trade-off must be negotiated and determined by the site&rsquo;s central purpose.</p>

<p>From Chapter 7&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>Roark looked at the sketches, and even though he wanted to throw them at Keating&rsquo;s face and resign, one thought stopped him: the thought that it was a building and that he had to save it, as others could not pass a drowning man without leaping in to the rescue.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://pirates.yahoo.com">Ahem&hellip;</a> <ins datetime="2008-03-26T00:33:45+00:00">NB: That link used to go to a site we built that was terrible. Now, thankfully, it goes somewhere less heinous. I&rsquo;m not trying to say anything negative about the Yahoo Movies site.  It&rsquo;s a great site built by great people.  The pirates &ldquo;brand universe&rdquo; site was a terrible site built by great people in a terrible situation.</ins></p>

<p>From Chapter 10&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>The house on the sketches had been designed not by Roark, but by the cliff on which it stood. It was as if the cliff had grown and completed itself and proclaimed the purpose for which it had been waiting.</blockquote>

<p>Great sites seem like they were designed and built not by the people on the team, but somehow simply grown forth from the needs that they fulfill.</p>

<p>From Chapter 13&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>Now, take a human body. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see a human body with a curling tail with a crest of ostrich feathers at the end? &hellip; It would be ornamental, you know, instead of the stark, bare ugliness we have now. Well, why don&rsquo;t you like the idea? Because it would be useless and pointless.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com">This site comes to mind</a>.  Know what happens to sites with too many noisy ads?  <a href="http://foohack.com/2007/09/whiting-out-ads-is-adblock-even-necessary-any-more/">They get ignored</a>.</p>

<p>From Chapter 13&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>The twelve faces before him had a variety of countenances, but there was something, neither color nor feature, uupon all of them, as a common denominator, something that dissolved their expressions, so that they were not faces any longer but only empty ovals of flesh.</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been in that meeting.</p>

<p>From Part 3, Chapter 8&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>It was a contest without time, a struggle of two abstractions, the thing that had created the building against things that made the play possible-two forces, suddenly naked to her in their simple statement-two forces that had fought since the world began-and every religion had known of them-and there had always been a God and a Devil-only men had been so mistaken about the shapes of their Devil-he was not single and big, he was many and smutty and small.</blockquote>

<p>Design by committee always leads to trouble.  Ultimately, it is one brain, unshared, that produces code, and decisions have to be made independently, even when we try to comply with some standard or another for the sake of <a href="http://foohack.com/2007/06/the-most-important-things-they-don%e2%80%99t-teach-in-compsci-101-but-should-maintainability/">maintainability</a>.</p>

<p>One of my favorite quotes ever, from Part 4, Chapter 8&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>My work done my way. A private, personal, selfish, egotistical motivation. That&rsquo;s the only way I function. That&rsquo;s all I am.</blockquote>

<p>The work is its own reward.  That&rsquo;s why so many webdevs were doing this before they started getting a paycheck for it.  <a href="http://foohack.com/2007/10/adhd-and-web-development/">It attracts the kind of people who are passionate and crazy about it.</a></p>

<p>About 100 pages later, there&rsquo;s this quote, also great&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>Independence is the only gauge of human virtue and value. What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or hasn&rsquo;t done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity.</blockquote>

<p>Professionally speaking, you are your skill, what you&rsquo;ve done for yourself with your own brain.  Your degree doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>I was thinking the other day about why I tend to brush past the &ldquo;How&rsquo;s work?&rdquo; question when well-meaning friends and relatives ask, but spend a bunch of time sharing my webdev related thoughts here on this site.  This quote from Chapter 8 sums it up:</p>

<blockquote>Sometimes, he was asked to show his sketches; he extended them across a desk, feeling a contraction of shame in the muscles of his hand; it was like having the clothes torn off his body, and the shame was not, that his body was exposed, but that it was exposed to indifferent eyes.</blockquote>

<p>There are countless more quotes that I could post.  I&rsquo;d post the whole book, but that would be plagiarism and 800 pages would make <abbr title="an even crappier">a crappy</abbr> blog entry.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a web developer haven&rsquo;t ever read The Fountainhead, or if you only read it in High School because you had to, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452286751/?tag=isaacschlcom-20">get a copy now</a>, and find the time to get into it.  You&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://sdpurtill.wordpress.com/2006/09/21/some-quotes-from-the-fountainhead-that-are-insane/">a lot</a> of <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/fou/QUO.htm">sites</a> out <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fountainhead+quotes">there</a> that have more quotes from the book.</p>

<h2>ADHD and Web Development</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on a site right now with Yahoo! that has not yet been released to the public, so I can&rsquo;t say too much about it.  When I first started here, I was on the games team.  Being a fairly avid chess player, <a href="http://games.yahoo.com">the games site</a> was a haunt of mine as early as 1997.  (In fact, it was the first Yahoo! offering that I used on a regular basis, and human-on-human chess remains one of my favorite Yahoo! products.)  However, most of the actual content on the site was not terribly thrilling to me, since I&rsquo;m not as into video games as I once was, and the latest match-three clone doesn&rsquo;t get me going.  It was a website, with business goals, and technical hurdles, and it was fun to solve the problems, but that&rsquo;s about as deep as it went.</p>

<p>Later, on the brand universe sites, we never really worked on a brand that I was all that into, and, between you me and the internet, I wasn&rsquo;t really all that happy with the direction that the product went in.  It was fun building modules, and challenging, and there were definite good times, but I definitely never went to those sites except to show someone what I had done.</p>

<p>This product, however, may well become my new starting page once it releases, or at least a frequently accessed bookmark.  Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s been a real challenge to actually get stuff done instead of just consuming all the great content that it is finding.</p>

<p>In a fit of cosmic irony, I came across <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/health/07essa.html?ex=1189656000&amp;en=f0e1ab4fcd4ed85c&amp;ei=5070">an article on the New York Times about <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr></a>.  While there&rsquo;s really nothing particularly controversial in Peter Steinberg&rsquo;s analysis, I was struck by this:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/health/07essa.html?ex=1189656000&amp;en=f0e1ab4fcd4ed85c&amp;ei=5070">For those of us who have &ldquo;attention-surplus disorder&rdquo; [&hellip;] this knowledge-based economy has been a godsend. We thrive.

But attention disorder cases, up to 5 to 15 percent of the population, are at a distinct disadvantage. What once conferred certain advantages in a hunter-gatherer era, in an agrarian age or even in an industrial age is now a potentially horrific character flaw, making people feel stupid or lazy and irresponsible, when in fact neither description is apt. </blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worn a lot of hats in my career.  I&rsquo;ve peddled vacuums, fixed computers, written documentation, led training classes, managed products from concept to deployment, designed logos, and built software in ASP, PHP, Javascript, CSS, VB and C++.  I&rsquo;ve walked a technically illiterate grandmother through a registry patch over the telephone.  I was more successful in some of these roles than in others, but all in all, I&rsquo;ve done alright.  I&rsquo;d definitely say that I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;knowledge worker.&rdquo;  And, I was diagnosed with AD(H)D as a child.  I took Ritalin until I rebelled against the establishment in High School and decided that I didn&rsquo;t need to be dosed.  By all accounts, I still have ADHD.  And, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be as good at what I do if I didn&rsquo;t have this so-called &ldquo;disorder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the words of Tyler Durden, <q>You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.</q>  While we all have our particular unique combination of traits, I&rsquo;m quite sure that there are lots and lots of people smarter and more successful than I am.  But, not to be too vain, I&rsquo;ve thrived in this knowledge economy, and I&rsquo;m equally sure that I&rsquo;m not the only person with an &ldquo;attention deficit&rdquo; who has managed to turn this mindset to their advantage.</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t people stop to wonder <em>why</em> their attention deficit child can&rsquo;t sit still and do spelling homework?  Because that crap is <em><abbr title="boring">BOOOOORRRRIIINNNNGGGG</abbr></em>.  Everyone&rsquo;s attention pretty much works the same way.  We all have different levels of instability in our attention.  My wife can start folding clothes, and just keep going until they&rsquo;re done.  She&rsquo;s a teensy bit OCD, which is just the other side of the attention-stability spectrum from ADHD.  (That&rsquo;s probably why we make such a good team.)</p>

<p>One commonly cited symptom of ADHD is the ability to get deeply immersed in certain tasks, almost to a ridiculous amount.  As a kid in the summer, I would put a new RPG into the Nintendo, and not move until I had beaten it.  I had a deficit of attention like the Pope has a deficit of catholicism.  A meteor could have landed on our roof, and I might not have noticed.  These days, it&rsquo;s web pages.  7:00 rolls around, and it takes an act of extreme willpower to &ldquo;switch off&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In programming, the right kind of laziness is good.  Each bit of functionality should only have to be written once; copy-and-paste programming is the ultimate in <a href="http://worsethanfailure">wtf-ery</a>.  A person with ADHD avoids boring behaviors because, to them, <em>boredom feels like dying</em>, and changing tasks is easy.  While &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people feel a sense of fear or nervousness that the things they leave won&rsquo;t get done, those of us with ADHD are quite content that we&rsquo;ll get to it later, after we do something else.  I&rsquo;m sure that there&rsquo;s some evolutionary justification for this, but all I know is that I&rsquo;d gladly get punched in the nose rather than write out those fucking spelling words 3 times each ever again.  <small>(Incidentally, there&rsquo;s some research out there indicating that childhood spelling education has little if any effect on adult spelling ability.)</small></p>

<p>I often hear this when I tell people that I&rsquo;m glad that I have ADHD: <q>Well, you&rsquo;re high-functioning.  My (sister, nephew, mother, uncle, friend) is so ADHD he can&rsquo;t even hold down a job.</q>  Listen, either your friend with ADHD hasn&rsquo;t found a job they love, or their problems run deeper than an attention instability.  &ldquo;High functioning,&rdquo; with respect to ADHD, is just a euphemism for &ldquo;found something you like doing that happens to pay well.&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m just as ADHD as I ever was.  My wife knows better than to send me to the store without a list, and is frequently (if understandingly) annoyed at my forgetful and distractable nature.</p>

<p>Most of the programmers I know, and nearly all of the web developers I know, have been diagnosed at some time or another with ADHD.  Now, of course, this is anecdotal evidence, and utterly painfully unscientific.  I&rsquo;m the first to cast doubt when there is a lack of hard stats on a topic, and I&rsquo;d absolutely love for some sociologist to do a proper study on this.  But how is it that there are so many people working as engineers and artists and executives working and making a living on the web who have been diagnosed with ADHD, if this disorder is such a liability in the Knowledge Economy?</p>

<p>I suspect that a part of the problem is that many people learn their sense of self-worth and competence at an early age, mostly based on their ability to please their parents and teachers.  A child with ADHD doesn&rsquo;t want to do his spelling homework, and speaking from experience, it was a frustrating and emotionally painful experience.  It&rsquo;s embarrassing.  A child who is embarrassed will naturally begin to think, <q>I&rsquo;m no good at this</q>.  That thought sticks.  It shapes their choices and the things that they&rsquo;re interested in.  Labeling ADHD a &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; and subjecting children to constant humiliation and parental frustration sends the message to that they aren&rsquo;t good at <em>just about everything</em>.  At the other extreme, ADHD children are often thought to need special help and attention, and the parent who wants to do right by their child shelters them from any kind of environment where they might fail.  They quickly learn that they&rsquo;re not as good as the other kids, and stop pushing themselves.</p>

<p><em>The most important thing is for a child to feel competent and successful at something that challenges them.</em>  This is actually pretty easy with ADHD kids, but only if parents are willing to look beyond the carbon-copy stimulation that most public schools offer.  Competence breeds interest, and interest motivates action, which in turn leads to more competence.  It&rsquo;s a virtuous cycle.  The non-high functioning ADHD patients probably need a shrink more than medication.  Their instability, properly harnessed, could be a source of tremendous power in the world.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll admit, occasionally I just don&rsquo;t feel like doing something, and it&rsquo;s really hard to get moving.  The drive that sustains me for hours of intensity can also turn in the other direction, and creating a new iTunes playlist is so fascinating I can&rsquo;t tear myself away.  But the benefit of web development is that there&rsquo;s always a lot of different things to do and it all tends to feel like playing.  The deadlines just add another element to the process, like the countdown in a video game that makes the adrenaline rise up and sharpen your wits.  But the slow times require you to be a patient teacher with yourself, and be firm but understanding.  So, I take 4 hour days sometimes, or spend the better part of the day reading through my friends&rsquo; twitter updates.  Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll make it up.  This slack-and-attack rhythm isn&rsquo;t so good in some fields, but it actually works quite well in most areas of the Knowledge Economy, since the person with instable attention frequently has a great breadth and depth of knowledge about the many various things that their interest drove them to.  <em>If</em>, of course, enough time is spent in &ldquo;attack&rdquo; mode to make a difference.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, we have a demo tomorrow.  So, writing this blog post <em>probably</em> isn&rsquo;t the best use of my time&hellip;</p>

<h2>Top 5 CSS Mistakes</h2>
<p>This is not a post about the top 10 mistakes that developers make when they write CSS.  That&rsquo;s boring.</p>

<p>The CSS spec <em>itself</em> is littered with mistakes.  Deep, fundamentally misguided errors.  Real head-slapping WTFs that make you wonder if the people writing the spec had ever created a website in their lives.  I&rsquo;m not exactly following <a href="http://foohack.com/2007/10/real-world-advice-for-fledgling-web-developers/">my own advice</a> by complaining, but I think of these more as the &ldquo;constructive criticism&rdquo; sort of complaints.</p>

<p>I love making web pages.  And, without being immodest, I&rsquo;m pretty good at CSS.  Not the best in the world, but certainly very familiar with it.  I do enjoy what CSS and semantic HTML lets you do with a web page.  But I am repeatedly annoyed by the language itself.</p>

<p>The saving grace, if there is one to be found here, is that browser makers are getting better and better at conforming to the spec with each version. Even IE is starting to catch up with the advent of IE 7.  While there will probably always be discrepancies and differences of opinion about how this or that feature should work, they&rsquo;re getting less obnoxious.  However, when the spec itself is broken, what can browser makers do?</p>

<h3>1. Inheritance</h3>

<p>Listen, CSS.  You have curly braces, why not use them?  The cascade is a nice feature, as is the default <code>inherit</code> value for most properties, but they&rsquo;re not enough.  This would be so lovely:</p>

<p><code class="block css">.some-module {
      font-weight:bold;
      text-align:right;
      p {
            font-weight:normal;
            text-align:center;
      }
      h3 {
            font-size:200%;
      }
}</code></p>

<p>Instead, we have to type <code>.some-module</code> over and over for every bloody rule.</p>

<p><code class="block css">.some-module {
      font-weight:bold;
      text-align:right;
}
.some-module  p {
      font-weight:normal;
      text-align:center;
}
.some-module h3 {
      font-size:200%;
}</code></p>

<p>If you use classes and descendant selectors properly on a sufficiently complicated page, you can get punished with very long selectors like this one from a site I&rsquo;m working on now: <code class="css">.nav .search a, .nav .search input, .nav .search .button, .nav .search label</code>.  Every freaking rule in the file has <code class="css">.nav .search</code> on the selector.  This simple addition to the spec would have made it so much better:</p>

<p><code class="block css">.nav {
  .tabs {
    /* css for the "tabs" section of the .nav module <em>/
  }
  .search {
    /</em> css for the "search" section of the nav module <em>/
    a, input, .button, label {
      /</em> css rules <em>/
    }
    a:hover, a:active {
      /</em> other CSS rules <em>/
      /</em> note the huge reduction in code to be typed! */
    }
  }
}</code></p>

<p>Almost every language supports some version of this kind of semantic inclusion, but for some reason, CSS was created in such a way that every rule lives in its own universe.  Lack of this feature makes CSS far less modular.</p>

<h3 id="p41_vertical_alignment">2. Vertical Alignment</h3>

<p>Almost <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vertical+centering+css">2 million pages about centering vertically in CSS</a>.  This was so unbelievably easy back in the bad old days of layout tables.  The browsers knew how to do it.  But as of the second revision, the CSS spec <em>still</em> doesn&rsquo;t even suggest a proper way to consistently vertically align one thing inside another.</p>

<p>Now, I know, there&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visudet.html#propdef-vertical-align"><code>vertical-align</code> property</a>.  But, that only applies to inline, inline-block, and table-cell elements.  If you want to align one box inside another, you&rsquo;re stuck doing all sorts of hacking to make it work.  If the heights are unknown ahead of time, it gets even more complicated.</p>

<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be such a huge problem, except that:</p>

<h3>3. Table display values should have been done far sooner</h3>

<p>OK, so step into the wayback machine, and travel to the 90s.  You&rsquo;re looking at an internet that is filled to the brim with poor abused tables.  &ldquo;Web developer&rdquo; basically means &ldquo;someone who knows how to use tables and font tags.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So why did we have to wait until CSS2 before there was <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html#display-prop">a way to emulate the behavior of the table tags</a>? If <code class="css">display:table</code> and <code class="css">display:table-cell</code> had been in the first release of CSS, the standards revolution would have gone off without a shot.  That&rsquo;s all it would have taken for the hoards of table masters to be swept up in the semantic content/style division paradigm.  Instead, CSS asked them to grasp &ldquo;floating&rdquo; and &ldquo;position&rdquo; and &ldquo;overflow&rdquo;, which are remarkably non-intuitive concepts when it comes to laying out content on a page.</p>

<p>By contrast, a grid that holds contents is extremely intuitive.  That&rsquo;s how typesetters had been laying out physical documents for millennia.  That&rsquo;s why <code>&lt;table cellspacing="0"&gt;</code> was such a godsend.</p>

<h3 id="p41_zindex">4. <code>z-index</code> is WAY too complicated</h3>

<p>If you know CSS, there&rsquo;s a good chance you know about <code>z-index</code>, or at least, think you do.  Odds are about 4 to 1 that it doesn&rsquo;t work how you think it does.  If you&rsquo;re like most web developers, rather than really understand it, you&rsquo;ve probably just messed with the item in question until the right things showed up.  (It doesn&rsquo;t help that there are tutorials out there that are deeply wrong when it comes to z-index.  If only it was as simple as <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_pos_z-index.asp">w3schools makes it out to be</a>!)</p>

<p>A decent summary can be found <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Understanding_CSS_z-index:The_stacking_context">the Mozilla Developer Center</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Understanding_CSS_z-index:The_stacking_context">In summary:
<ul><li>Positioning and assigning a z-index value to an HTML element creates a stacking context.</li>
    <li>Stacking contexts can be contained in other stacking contexts, and together create a hierarchy of stacking contexts.</li>
    <li>Each stacking context is completly <ins>[sic]</ins> independent from its siblings: only descendant elements are considered when stacking is processed.</li>
    <li>Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element&rsquo;s contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context. </li>
</ul>

Notes:

<ul><li>The hierarchy of stacking contexts is a subset of the hierarchy of HTML elements, because only positioned and z-indexed elements create stacking contexts. We can say that elements that do not create their own stacking contexts are assimilated by the parent stacking context.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, this is just the <em>summary</em>.  The full discussion is much longer and more complicated.</p>

<p>So, if element A contains X and Y, and element B contains P and Q, and A is above B, then X and Y are also above P and Q, <em>even if P and Q have a much larger z-index than A, X, or Y.</em>  But, only if A is positioned.  The idea is to keep any stacking &ldquo;local&rdquo; between siblings, so that the stacking of parent elements can be ignored.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if some browser maker lobbied for this rule because it made their Dom-walking algorithm simpler.  And I can imagine some strange hypothetical super-modular layout situations where it might be handy.  But it&rsquo;s wrong, and exceedingly problematic for the vast majority of situations.  In reality, it leads to newer web developers thinking, <q>What the hell?  I gave this thing z-index 99, and that other thing has z-index:1, and it&rsquo;s above it?</q></p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Why make it so complicated? Back when I was doing technical documentation at a software company, I had a saying: if it&rsquo;s hard to explain, it&rsquo;s probably badly designed. Partly out of laziness, and partly out of responsibility, I&rsquo;d submit bugs to the developers when something was just too damn complicated. Here&rsquo;s a better way:</p>

<ul><li>Any element that is not <code>display:none</code> has a z-index.</li>
    <li>Valid z-index values are either an integer, like <code>7</code>, or the word <code>inherit</code> and optionally an integer modifier, such as <code>inherit 2</code> (2 higher than whatever the parent is) or <code>inherit -1</code> (1 lower than the parent).  If <code>inherit</code> is used without a number, it defaults to <code>inherit 0</code>.</li>
    <li>Elements that don&rsquo;t have an explicit z-index are assumed to have the z-index of their parent. (I.e., <code>z-index:inherit 0</code>.)</li>
    <li>Elements stack on the page according to their computed z-index.</li>
</ul><p>How hard is that to understand?  You can still use stacking contexts if you want, by using relative values, but without all the complications of having to trace through your page and figure out which parent needs to get <code>position:relative</code> in order to make your overlay lay over the rest of the page.</p>

<p>The day I grokked z-index is the day I realized that CSS is an insane and over-engineered language.</p>

<p><a href="http://seldo.com">Laurie</a> points out that <q>If you have a drop-in html widget that&rsquo;s all nicely z-ordered, you don&rsquo;t want it to accidentally be interleaving with other elements on that page.</q>  I&rsquo;m sure this was the thinking behind the stacking context in the first place.  However, you would still be able to accomplish this with the <code>inherit</code> values.  Just give each module a <code>z-index</code> in multiples of 100, and then use relative z-indexes within the modules.  With all due respect, Laurie, as far as FooHack is concerned, the existing z-index paradigm is wrong, and CSS is being sent to the corner to think about what it&rsquo;s done.</p>

<h3 id="quirks_is_right">5. The Quirks Box Model is Right</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you have a bookshelf that you&rsquo;re going to put in your home.  You measure the space on the wall to know how big of a bookshelf you can fit in the room.  You find that there&rsquo;s a space 34 inches across.  When you go to the store, you get one that says its 33 inches wide, and bring it home, and assemble it, and it doesn&rsquo;t fit!  It&rsquo;s an extra inch too wide, and now your closet door can&rsquo;t open.  You take it back to the store, and the salesperson calmly tells you, <q>Well sir, the edge of the bookshelf is an inch wide.  You see, you can only fit 33 inches of books on this shelf.</q>  You&rsquo;d probably be quite perplexed, annoyed, and begin to wonder what kind of fairy land you&rsquo;ve fallen into where they measure the insides of things first, and the outsides only as an afterthought.</p>

<p>In a rare fit of reasonableness, MSIE 5 did it right (and so does MSIE 6 when in Quirks Mode.)  If you set the width to 100px, then it&rsquo;s 100px.  If you put 10px of padding on the box, then it leaves 80px inside for the text.</p>

<p>CSS disagrees with reason, however, and the spec says that a 100px wide box with 10px of padding will <em>actually</em> be 120px across, because the width of an element specifies the width of the <em>inside</em>, not the width of the <em>element</em>.</p>

<p>For images, this makes sense.  If an image is 50px wide, and has 10px of padding, then you&rsquo;d expect the width to specify the width of the asset itself (the image file) and the padding to get added onto that.  But it would be a far far better decision to make it a little bit tricky for the rare case where you specify the width of images in the CSS rather than tricky for the much more common case where you specify the width of anything else.</p>

<p>The MSIE Quirks width was right.  Too bad its dead and gone.  Now, simply to get around what, in my opinion, is a horrible paradigm, I never set width or height on the same module where I set borders and padding.  Width goes on the parent, and then borders and padding go on a <code class="css">width:auto</code> child.</p>

<h3>Other suggestions that didn&rsquo;t make the list&hellip;</h3>

<ul><li>style block is invalid in the body, just annoying</li>
    <li>min-height and min-width being unsupported</li>
    <li>one background per element</li>
    <li>no background clipping</li>
    <li>no background-opacity distinct from element opacity</li>
    <li>% font sizes being relative to parent, not base</li>
    <li>border treatments</li>

<h2>Real World Advice for Fledgling Web Developers</h2>
<p><cite>I originally posted this at <a href="http://isaacschlueter.com/2006/09/advice-for-new-web-developers/">isaacschlueter.com</a> on <abbr title="2006-09-07T18:42:45-07:00">September 7th, 2006</abbr>.  I&rsquo;ve updated it slightly.</cite></p>

<p>Today <ins>[that is, on 2006-09-07]</ins> a fellow front-end engineer here at Yahoo! asked <abbr title="the webdevs who read devel-frontend">us</abbr> for bits of real-world advice that we would give to up-and-coming front-end engineering students.  He&rsquo;s doing a talk at a school, and was curious about what we&rsquo;ve learned.  It struck me as a perfect idea for a blog post.</p>

<p>Any other front-end professionals out there?  What would be your pieces of advice?</p>

<p>As front-end engineers, we can&rsquo;t get away with being over-specialized.  We are the ones who talk to everyone.
We integrate with backend engineers.
We get comps from designers.
We tell product managers what can and can&rsquo;t be done in today&rsquo;s browsers.
And, of course, our code is what the user actually gets.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the most hostile arena <small>(except perhaps mobile)</small> in which to create software, but it can be deeply rewarding.</p>

<p>A good front-end engineer is someone with insatiable curiosity and drive.  You can&rsquo;t just be the &ldquo;flash guy&rdquo; or the &ldquo;javascript guy&rdquo; or the &ldquo;css guy&rdquo; if you really want to go far in this discipline.  You can&rsquo;t look at a php bug and say &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a back-end issue,&rdquo; or look at an image that needs to be sliced up, and say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a design issue.&rdquo;  You need to be able to work in many different lands.  More and more, web applications are integrating many different technologies within the browser window.</p>

<p>Learn everything.  Since you can&rsquo;t ever actually do that, learn as much as you can.  Learn how to learn quickly.  Eat, drink, and breathe css and javascript.  Install apache on your home computer and learn how it works.  Play around with PHP and Ruby on Rails and Flash.  Write a blog.  Redesign it on the weekend.  Play around with Photoshop.  Fall in love with this field, and let it consume you.</p>

<p>Most of the documentation out there is terrible.  Get used to it.  Chances are, the person who developed this-or-that thing was too busy to really explain how it works, or English is his second language, or he just never realized that someone else might find it useful.  The newer the technology is, the more likely it is to be poorly documented.  Learn how to search for your answers within the community, and test everything.  Improve the quality of the knowledge base by adding to it.  Complaining helps no one.</p>

<p>The specific tricks and languages that you learn in a typical computer science program are almost all useless in front-end engineering.  This is a cutting-edge discipline, and no school could ever hope to keep up with it.  Textbooks are usually written years ago, and every problem in them is already solved.  This field is all about finding and solving new problems that no one has ever thought of.  That sounds cool, but it&rsquo;s also a ton of work.  You need to be a little crazy to want this job.  If you don&rsquo;t love it, you&rsquo;ll hate it.</p>

<p>Be nice to people.  You never know when they&rsquo;ll come in handy.  Be strict in what you send, and accepting in what you receive, whether you&rsquo;re talking about requests over a network or manners in a meeting.  You don&rsquo;t know what constraints someone had to deal with when they built something.  The classic n00b mistake is to start out criticizing everyone, but that doesn&rsquo;t help anyone.  If you can do it better, do it; and then share it, discuss it, and document it.  You don&rsquo;t know the pressures that others are under, so be gentle when you tell them that something they want is impossible.</p>

<p>Be ready to compromise, with yourself and with others.  The perfect system may take 10 days to create&mdash;you&rsquo;ll probably have 3.  Learn how to crunch and cut corners without sacrificing the quality of the end result.  Build quality up front, and fill in the details as you go.  Design your code in layers so that you&rsquo;ll have something worthwhile, even if you don&rsquo;t get to the end.  Know how to cut out unnecessary features, and be ruthless with the red pen when necessary.  Know how to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a request if it can&rsquo;t be done in time, even if you&rsquo;d really love to do it.  But find out what&rsquo;s really important, and make sure that it gets in there.</p>

<p>Hack! Play! Innovate!</p>

<h2>Applescript for iTerm (and a request for help with it)</h2>
<p><a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/" rev="vote-for">iTerm</a> is a major part of my workspace.  I&rsquo;m a big fan of tabbed interfaces, and my fingers have gotten really good at the Apple-← and Apple-→ key combos to swap between them.  I usually have three tabs going:</p>

<ol><li>One that runs <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/" rev="vote-for">Unison</a> in batch mode to keep my mac and BSD machines in sync.  I set the title of this one to &ldquo;unisoner&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>A second logged into my BSD machine in the package folder to easily relink the site package when I add files to it.  This is the &ldquo;relinker&rdquo;.  (Also, this one occasionally is used to <code>tail -f</code> on the apache log file.)</li>
    <li>A third sitting in my code folder to do CVS updates, open files, grep for stuff, etc.  This is &ldquo;cvser&rdquo;.</li>
</ol><p>Of course, it&rsquo;s a pain to go through the steps to set all this up.  So, I wrote this Applescript, and it does it all:</p>

<p><code class="block applescript">tell Application "iTerm"
  activate
  set myterm to (make new terminal)
  tell myterm
    if (count of sessions) &lt; 3 then
      my open_tab("title unisoner
cd dev/orion
unisonpush
unisondev")
      my open_tab("v
yroot orion_front
title relinker-tailer
cd dev/orion/front/package
yapl")
      my open_tab("title cvser
cd dev/orion
open -a TextMate orion.tmproj")
    end if
  end tell
  terminate first session of current terminal
end tell
on open_tab(command)
  tell Application "iTerm" to tell first terminal
    launch session "Default Session"
    tell last session
      write text command
    end tell
  end tell
end run_command</code></p>

<p>The only problem is, it requests a password when it ssh'es into my dev box and changes to the project root.  So, that whole piece falls down.</p>

<p>Anyone out there in geek land know of a way to make an Applescript respond to things like that?  Something like this:</p>

<p><code class="block applescript broken">whenever the last line is "Password:" then
  write text returned of (display dialog "Password:" default answer "")
end if</code></p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>Turns out, what I suggested is pretty close to what works.  However, since there&rsquo;s no event to listen for that would tell the script that the display has been updated, it takes a bit of fudging, and doesn&rsquo;t always work perfectly.  Basically, you put <code>@@@PASSWORD@@@</code> in the list of commands where you may expect a password prompt, and it&rsquo;ll wait for a second and display a dialog if necessary.</p>

<p><code class="block applescript">
on open_tab(command)
  set commands to paragraphs in command
  
  tell Application "iTerm" to tell first terminal
    launch session "Default Session"
    repeat with currentCommand in commands
      
      if (text of currentCommand = "@@@PASSWORD@@@") then
        do shell script "sleep 1"
        set pw to last word of (get contents of last session)
        if pw = "Password" then
          tell Application "Finder"
            activate
            set pw to text returned of (display dialog "Password:" default answer "" with hidden answer)
          end tell
          tell Application "iTerm" to activate
          tell last session to write text pw
        end if
        
      else
        tell last session to write text currentCommand
      end if
      
      
    end repeat
    
  end tell
end open_tab</code></p>

<p>Get the finished product: <a href="http://foohack.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/workspace.applescript" title="Applescript for iTerm">Applescript for iTerm</a>.  You&rsquo;ll want to change up the specific commands up near the top, of course.</p>
