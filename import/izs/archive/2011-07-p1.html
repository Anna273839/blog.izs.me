<h2>Obvious Answers to Simple Questions</h2>
<p>People who live or work with nerds sometimes are annoyed and perplexed by what strikes them as willful, snarky, unhelpful responses to questions.</p>

<pre><code>q: Do you know what time it is?
a: Yes.
&lt;beat&gt;
q: Ok... What time is it?   (asshole)
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>q: How are you going to the party Saturday?
a: I'm driving.
q: Yeah, but are you taking the 101 or the 280?    (asshole)
</code></pre>

<p>Programming is a deep and complicated field.  There are very many layers of abstraction between the user&rsquo;s intent and the electrons on silicon.</p>

<p>When working on a problem, it&rsquo;s common to be so immersed in it that everything seems obvious.  In fact, until this level of familiarity is achieved, it&rsquo;s hard to make any progress at all.</p>

<p>However, other parts of the stack may still be very foreign.  This is part of why software development is a social activity.  There&rsquo;s simply too much for any one person to hold the entire stack in their head at once.</p>

<p>So, you ask someone a question.  A question that seems obvious to them, <em>but isn&rsquo;t to you</em>, because you&rsquo;re not immersed in that part of the world.</p>

<p>And the polite and kind thing for them to do is try to answer your question as precisely and accurately as possible, <em>even though it seems obvious to them and isn&rsquo;t something they&rsquo;d ever bother asking</em>, because they realize that you don&rsquo;t live in the same area that they do.</p>

<p>In the ancestral environment, everyone knew most of what everyone else knew.  Even if there were specific details that were shared in bits, it was unlikely that someone didn&rsquo;t even know the rudimentary basics of any particular subject.  So, when asked a question, the polite thing for the answerer to do is skip past any details that the asker probably already knows, and try to infer the bits that they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Most of human social interaction happens in this sort of framework.  You probably know I&rsquo;m driving, and are <em>really</em> asking which specific route I&rsquo;m taking, or which car, or when I&rsquo;m leaving.  Answering with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m driving&rdquo; is akin to saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot who doesn&rsquo;t know what a car is, but I&rsquo;m going to step down off my Smart People pedestal, where we Speak Properly, and help educate you, so that you can learn to not be so dumb.   Here&rsquo;s where the key goes&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not (just) that nerds are fundamentally more persnickety, or detail-oriented, or hyper-literal.  Those things may factor into our oddness, or into our choice of careers, but a large part of this social disconnect is that we actively learn to break this evolved habit.</p>

<p>Our culture and craft depend on responding to simple questions with obvious answers, out of respect for the fact that what is obvious to me may not be obvious to you, even though we&rsquo;re both competent, intelligent, worldly people with nothing of the best intentions.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s no excuse for being a dick, of course.  Rudeness—especially unintended rudeness—is not the Winful Way.  But it&rsquo;s hard to shift cultures, especially when our friends are also our colleagues, and social interactions often include technical conversations.</p>

<h2>Benchmark: Array-ification of arguments</h2>
<p>Having really hot paths in your code can be great, but it can also be a little dangerous.</p>

<p>When v8&rsquo;s Crankshaft landed in the Node.js dev build, it immediately resulted in a significant drop in Node&rsquo;s &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; performance benchmark.</p>

<p>This was alarming.  Crankshaft was supposed to be faster, and here it was causing slowdowns.</p>

<p>The cause was tracked down Vyacheslav Egorov (known to many in the Node community as &ldquo;mraleph&rdquo;), and had to do with Node&rsquo;s use of the <code>arguments</code> object in the <code>EventEmitter.prototype.emit</code> function.</p>

<p>Since this function is the hottest code in Node, even a slight decrease in performance is immediately felt.  Vyacheslav discussed <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/commit/91f1b250ecb4fb8151cd17423dd4460652d0ce97">the commit</a> in <a href="https://plus.google.com/111090511249453178320/posts/ikjTyY6UKcE">a google plus post</a>.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about the best ways to convert the <code>arguments</code> object, or part of it, to a standard JavaScript <code>Array</code>.  I pulled out <a href="https://raw.github.com/isaacs/node-bench">the node benchmarking thing I wrote</a>, and wrote up <a href="https://raw.github.com/isaacs/node-bench/master/examples/array-ify.js">two</a> <a href="https://raw.github.com/isaacs/node-bench/master/examples/array-ify-offset.js">tests</a></p>

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>

<p>This advice is only relevant in the latest v8.  By the time you read it, it&rsquo;s already out of date and incorrect.  Just stop now, run your own tests, and make your own choices.</p>

<p>If node.js is still using v8 version 3.4.12.1, then it <em>might</em> be just a <em>little</em> valid for your node programs, but otherwise, no.  Stop.  Don&rsquo;t even continue reading.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>First, if your function takes a variable number of arguments, and you don&rsquo;t know how many it will be called with <strong>do not define any named parameters</strong>.  It makes things more complicated, and dramatically slows down the process.</p>

<p>Want to just put all the <code>arguments</code> in an array?  Do this:</p>

<pre><code>function varArgsList () {
  var args = arguments.length === 1
           ? [arguments[0]] : Array.apply(null, arguments)
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s an order of magnitude faster than <code>Array.prototype.slice.call</code> or <code>[].slice.call</code>.</p>

<p>Want to get all the arguments in a particular slice?  (Like, say, everything after the first, or the second until the second-to-last, etc.)  Well, that&rsquo;s a bit more complicated.  There, as with the patch from Mr. Aleph, you&rsquo;ve gotta walk the list yourself.</p>

<p>For example, to do the equivalent of <code>Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 1)</code>, pulling off every argument after the first, the fastest method seems to be this:</p>

<pre><code>function manualMap () {
  var l = arguments.length
  var arr = new Array(l - 1)
  for (var i = 1; i &lt; l; i ++) arr[i - 1] = arguments[i]
</code></pre>

<p>The fastest, if you know exactly which arguments are which, is to refer to them as <code>arguments[i]</code>, and only array-ify if and when it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary.  So, not surprisingly, I was unable to out-perform Mr. Aleph in a v8 benchmark-off.  My goal in this was simply to figure out <em>how much</em> of a difference it makes, and write a script to check it later, in case I find myself in a similar situation again.</p>

<p>Of course, <code>[].slice.call(arguments, 1, 2)</code> is far fewer bytes, and easier to know what&rsquo;s going on.  For most programs, the slight difference is not going to affect your overall program.  But sometimes hot code is hot enough to slow your benchmarks down by 20% because of what seems like a trivial change.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only over-optimizing if it doesn&rsquo;t make a significant difference.</p>

<h2>Nuno's</h2>
<p>nuno: Email is such a huge part of my life.  I need to say "No" to a lot of people.<br>
isaacs: It'd be cool if there was an app to do that for you.<br>
nuno: Yeah, it could be almost like an autoresponder or something.<br>
isaacs: And you could have some kind of Markov thing to come up with innovative and creative ways to say no to everything.<br>
nuno: That'd be great!<br>
isaacs: You should write that.  You could call it "Nuno's New No's".<br>
mikeal: You were thinking about that for a while, huh?<br>
isaacs: It was either that or a rhinoplasty joke.</p>
