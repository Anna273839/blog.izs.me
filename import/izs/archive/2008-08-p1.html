<h2>A Conversation about Redux Getting Their Users Laid</h2>
<p>When I was at GoogleIO, I received an email from Brent Griffith, one of the guys on the team behind <a href="http://redux.com">Redux.com</a>.  Redux was <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=278501">mentioned recently on Hacker News</a>, and rather than rewrite much of this commentary, I figured it would be more interesting to just post the conversation here.</p>

<p>Slightly edited to remove non-public and irrelevant bits. All substantive content is left completely unchanged.</p>

<p><small>Savvy readers will note that I basically just took something <a href="http://www.jwz.org/">jwz</a> said 3 years prior, and applied it to this situation.  Shoulders, giants, etc.</small></p>

<p class="greeting">Hi Isaac,</p>

<p>My name is Brent and I noticed from your site, foohack, that we both share an interest in technology. I am always looking to network with other passionate individuals in this industry. I&rsquo;m an early employee at Redux, a startup in the discovery space. We just raised&hellip; <small>[some specifics about their funding which might not be public, I&rsquo;m not sure.]</small></p>

<p>We&rsquo;re a group of mostly engineers, and we&rsquo;re always looking out for super-motivated, talented and outstanding developers to work with us.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you&rsquo;re up for chatting sometime about Redux.</p>

<p>(if you would like to read more about Redux before we chat, you can go to <a href="http://www.redux.com/about.html">http://www.redux.com/about.html</a>. I can also give you an account to our private beta)</p>

<p><small>[contact info removed]</small></p>

<p class="signoff">Best,
Brent</p>

<hr><p><small>[Times and when to talk. Brent sends me a link to the beta.  We fail at IM.]</small></p>

<p><small>[Final &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you at this date/time&rdquo;. Giving up on IM.]</small></p>

<p>FYI, not that this was necessarily your aim, I&rsquo;m really not interested in leaving Yahoo any time in the near future.</p>

<p>I signed up for the beta. Looks interesting. Speaking of GoogleIO, is open social on your radar? Seems like OpenID/OAuth/OpenSocial could add an awful lot to your application with minimal overhead on your part. My gut reaction when it asked for a profile and avatar was &ldquo;Aw, jeez, another one?&rdquo; Seems like it would be a better strategy for you guys to focus on just the parts of your app that are unique and interesting, and outsource the rest. Again, just a 10-second reaction, I&rsquo;ll delve into it more later.</p>

<p class="signoff">Cheers!

<p><small>[Availability confirmation.  Acknowledgement of total IM fail.]</small></p>

<p>Yes, very perceptive. For sure, we are definitely watching Open Social and especially Facebook&rsquo;s &ldquo;opening moves&rdquo; (lol). I agree with you about the focus statement. We are actually in a debate currently about whether/how to simplify and &ldquo;go back to basics.&rdquo; I hope we do.</p>

<p>I look forward to our talk,</p>

<p>Some other thoughts on Redux, no doubt influenced by thinking and talking intensely about the social web for a while, especially today and yesterday.</p>

<p>Have you read this article?  <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html">http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html</a></p>

<p>I stumbled across it a few years ago, and it provides an absolutely brilliant razer for developing software with any kind of social component. (Which, today, is almost all software, period.)</p>

<p>It seems like there&rsquo;s something oddly promising in Redux, but the value that it adds doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s exposed very well, or like it&rsquo;s somehow unfocused. It almost seems at first like it&rsquo;s trying to be YouTube or iLike or Facebook&hellip; but the vitality and social-ness isn&rsquo;t done as well as Facebook, and the ratings and recommendations interaction isn&rsquo;t on par with iLike, and the videos are all available on YouTube anyhow&hellip; It feels like I&rsquo;m missing something. I suspect that if I&rsquo;m missing it, then the average 20-something in his dorm room will miss it too, and instead of telling you, he&rsquo;ll just go back to using Facebook, because that&rsquo;s how he meets girls, and that&rsquo;s all he cares about. (I&rsquo;m guessing from the &ldquo;chick&rdquo; and &ldquo;dude&rdquo;, he&rsquo;s who you&rsquo;re going after?)</p>

<p>The design is certainly nicer looking than any of those sites (by a wide margin!) but I suspect that most people don&rsquo;t much care about that. They&rsquo;ve used plain text email and SMS forever, and MySpace is still extremely popular, despite looking like absolute hell. As an artist who cares about nice-looking and well-structured web pages (kudos on the clean semantic markup, btw), that matters a lot to me. But I&rsquo;m in a very tiny minority. That 20-something is using MySpace for one reason, which is the only thing that he cares about. (Actually, these days, it&rsquo;s a 30-something using MySpace, but let&rsquo;s face it, that guy didn&rsquo;t change much in 10 years.)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re going to be a value-added aggregator that looks nice, why not actually be an aggregator, and aggregate really well? Use OAuth to link up with my Facebook or Twitter profile, and get my status/vitality events from there. Let me similarly link up with my Flickr account, and get a photo stream. If I have a friend on Facebook or Twitter or Myspace or, eventually, any OpenSocial container site, then show me their updates on Redux, so you &ldquo;redux&rdquo; the social graph as well as the content. (I think that Google FriendFinder might be useful or at least instructive, but I&rsquo;m not terribly familiar with what they&rsquo;ve done.) Try to pull their ratings and reviews from Yelp or CitySearch or Yahoo Local. And so on.</p>

<p>My suggestion would be to try to do as little as possible&ndash;and more importantly, ask your <em>users</em> to do as little as possible outside of their ordinary routine&ndash;in order to bring all these aspects of personal brand to one slick interface. Redux could be essentially a nice set of CSS styling around a collection of curl calls to various web services that <em>other</em> people (with deeper pockets) build and maintain for you, combined with an incredibly easy interface for users to add content to their personal list. So incredibly easy, in fact, that it&rsquo;s painful by comparison to go post a video on Facebook. That&rsquo;s a tall order, but I&rsquo;m sure there are creative ways to do it. (Perhaps by tying into Facebook with an app that posts your Redux stuff to Facebook and vice-versa.)</p>

<p>But, of course, if you&rsquo;re <em>just</em> an aggregator, then that&rsquo;s boring. It only gets exciting when you start showing me other people&ndash;especially strangers (or even better, FOAFs) of similar age and opposite sex&ndash;who like the same things. Then the value proposition is, &ldquo;Do whatever you want anywhere, but come here to find people who are into the same things.&rdquo; It seems like that&rsquo;s closer to the core value proposition of Redux, surfacing people based on interests, but it&rsquo;s hidden under a lot of copycat baloney.</p>

<p>That will help your users get laid, because:</p>

<ol><li>it will help them traverse the search space more efficiently,</li>
<li>it will help them create an advertisement to attract attention, and</li>
<li>it will provide them with a selection of ice-breakers for potential partners.</li>
</ol><p>By the way, being able to view a person&rsquo;s profile, and click the name of a thing, and then add it to my profile&hellip; deviously brilliant. <q>You like XYZ? Oh my god, I do too!</q> or on the flip side, <q>He seems nice, but on his profile, he just has everything I do, even misspelled the same way. How pathetic.</q></p>

<p>If it sounds crude to reduce product decisions to &ldquo;get my users laid,&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile to remember that this is just a stand-in for ALL social interaction. It just so happens that attracting a mate is about the most challenging and high-priority sort of human interaction, so if you can manage to help people out with that, you&rsquo;ll also help them connect with their friends and family and coworkers. That&rsquo;s why Facebook and MySpace are more far popular than any dating site; it&rsquo;s like comparing meeting someone at work or school with meeting them at a singles bar.</p>

<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m saying is that I hope you decide to go back to basics as well, largely because I think Redux seems to have the potential to be extremely cool, and I&rsquo;d like to use it. As a young small company, you have the advantage of being able to identify the key area of differentiation, focus on it, and out-iterate the big guys. Pick the wrong area, and you lose. Pick the right area, and they can&rsquo;t hope to keep up with their army of feature-happy and eyeball-greedy product managers. The open source community in the social web space is coming to the point where you don&rsquo;t need to re-invent the other bits. Along with product managers, the big guys have armies of developers to do all the mundane stuff, and can run in many more directions at once than you can.</p>

<p>&lt;/$0.02&gt;</p>

<p class="greeting">Isaac,</p>

<p>Wow, just wow. Amazing, yours is probably the most thoughtful feedback we have received from any of our beta users. I really appreciate you taking your time to do that.</p>

<p>Great article. Thanks for sharing. I had never read that before, but it gets right at the heart of it. I particularly like that part, <q>The trick you want to accomplish is that when one person is using your software, it suddenly provides value to that person and their entire circle of friends, without the friends having had to do anything at all. Then, later, you pull the friends into the fold: if one of them starts using the software, they become their own hub, and get the benefit they have already witnessed from a distance.</q> I believe that should be our goal and I think that with the new iteration of the site we are moving towards it.</p>

<p>I agree about your discussion on focus. I think that this is what we will accomplish by stripping down the site from the bloated legacy code that Redux is in its current state. We built the current version of Redux on top of our previous iteration and this was probably a mistake, thus why we have decided to simplify and refocus and build on top of that. We are also planning on aggregating like you said, linking up with Facebook and other networks. We&rsquo;re very excited about the refocus and where our site is headed.</p>

<p>Once again, thank you immensely for your insightful and thoughtful feedback. I have distributed it throughout the organization for people to think about.</p>

<p>I look forward to our conversation tomorrow.</p>

<hr><p>The phone conversation was interesting, but since it wasn&rsquo;t recorded digitally like the email thread, I forgot most of it.  I remember being entertained by it, which is all I&rsquo;d been looking for.  Hopefully it was worth Brent&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>Now that Redux is getting a bit more attention, I&rsquo;m considering working this into an article on Foohack. (With all contact info stripped out, of course.) Any objections?</p>

<h2>Why I'm Not Working on My Startup (Yet)</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s nature or nurture, but either way, the savvy gambler will bet that I&rsquo;m going to run my own company at some point.  I grew up in an entrepreneurial house.  I share a Y-chromosome with a guy who built up a company and made it work with the (un)usual combination of moxie and dedication and wit that makes any business work.  And, he did so with two small children.  No small feat.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always planned on starting my own company.  I&rsquo;ve been a fan of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham&rsquo;s writing</a> ever since I discovered it.  I live in Silicon Valley, and the startup vibe is in the air.  I work as a web developer, and I&rsquo;m good at what I do.  I am very interested in the business of software, and have a lot of ideas about how things could be done in new and better ways.  It&rsquo;s not so much &ldquo;if&rdquo;, but &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;when&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked at Yahoo for 2.5 years now, already about 6 months longer than I&rsquo;d initially expected to.  Compared with working at a small company, it has many advantages.  I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to be a part of several different projects, and Yahoo can afford to pay quite a bit more than my former employer ever could.  I&rsquo;ve been able to talk to and work with some of the most gifted hackers I could ever hope for.  When I got the job, it was really a dream come true, and I&rsquo;m still proud to be one of the cogs in this engine.  It&rsquo;s been even more satisfying than I&rsquo;d thought it would be.</p>

<p>But there are drawbacks as well.  In a company of Yahoo&rsquo;s size, bureaucracy creeps in.  Decisions are sometimes made very far from the code, and even further from the users.  Despite Jerry&rsquo;s and Ari&rsquo;s best intentions&mdash;and sternest directives&mdash;when they talk about Open Initiatives, the &ldquo;not invented here&rdquo; syndrome can cause big problems.  I don&rsquo;t think I coined the term, but I&rsquo;ve taken to referring to the malaise as the &ldquo;purple cloud&rdquo;, a stifling and noxious gas that obscures reason and reduces visibility.  No doubt about it: that part of the job sucks.</p>

<p>On an almost daily basis, I&rsquo;m tempted to quit and strike out on my own.  Yahoo is an unusually good employer.  But despite the perks, as long as I work at Yahoo, I don&rsquo;t work for Isaac.  I might love the company, love what we&rsquo;re doing, love the opportunities it affords, but there is a definite lack of control and lack of ownership that leaves me unsatisfied sometimes.  Being a manager wouldn&rsquo;t solve the problem; it would make it much much worse.  At least as a hacker, I fully own the code I write.  If I can&rsquo;t be on the top, I&rsquo;d rather be as close to the code as possible.  (Best would be both at once, of course.)</p>

<h3>So Why Not Leave?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of articles recently with titles like <q>Why you should quit your job and start a company</q> and <q>Why you should keep your day job and work on your startup at night</q>.  I know my hacking rhythm pretty well by this point.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve gathered from these resources and my own introspection is:</p>

<ol><li>It&rsquo;s incredibly hard to focus on a startup and also have a separate full-time job.</li>
    <li>It&rsquo;s even harder to focus on a startup and not pay rent or eat.</li>
    <li>If I spend less than 50 hours a week working, I&rsquo;ll go crazy.</li>
    <li>If I spend more than 30 hours a week working on something I don&rsquo;t love, I&rsquo;ll go crazy.</li>
    <li>If I&rsquo;m working on something I love, and I&rsquo;m not working on it all the time, I&rsquo;ll go crazy.</li>
</ol><p>Going crazy is not an option.  This isn&rsquo;t the fun crazy with mania and interesting delusions; more like the super-depressed, hate-my-life, stop-communicating-with-other-humans kind of crazy.  I&rsquo;ve been there before.  Life&rsquo;s too short for that.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;8+2&rdquo; workday wouldn&rsquo;t work for me.  I&rsquo;ve tried it.  I hated it, with a burning passion.  I&rsquo;ve always had side projects, but they remain on the side (like this blog.)  I go through phases of being very interested and working hard on them, and completely ignore them at other times.  If I had to focus on them enough to turn them into something that users would pay money for, it would have to turn into a full-time gig.  My ventures into paying side-projects were tremendous failures for that reason.</p>

<p>Even more importantly, I can&rsquo;t work just 8 hours a day.  Either you ride the biorhythm, with its highs and lows, and capitalize on every bit of go-time that your brain gives you, or you crank out boring hours for your handful of dimes.  &ldquo;Healthy work-life balance&rdquo; is for bank tellers.  An artist doesn&rsquo;t stop being an artist when he goes home.</p>

<p>I love what I do at Yahoo, and I care enough about what we create that I want to focus all my energy on creating value for users.  It&rsquo;s good practice.  But as long as I work at this job, I won&rsquo;t have enough left over at the end of the day to seriously invest in anything else.  Some people can find a middle ground there; I&rsquo;ve learned that I can&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;m ok with that.</p>

<p>I also really hate worrying about bills.  One joy of working for Yahoo is that I get paid enough that I don&rsquo;t know exactly how much a cup of coffee costs.  In poorer times in my life, I was acutely aware of every nickel increase in the cost of a pack of cigarettes.  That sucks.  Living economically is just good sense; deciding whether your last $10 should be spent on gas or dinner seriously gets in the way of enjoying life.</p>

<h3>Having My Cake&hellip;</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my plan: keep working at Yahoo for the next 2-3 years or so.  Pare down my expenses as much as possible during that time, and sock away as much money as I can.  When I have enough saved to live for at least a year without a job, I&rsquo;ll quit my job and work on whatever idea seems the most promising at that time.</p>

<p>You see, the idea is the cheapest part.  Ideas are so plentiful once you learn how to cultivate them, they may as well be falling from the sky.  And my ideas have tended to be at least good enough, even if they&rsquo;re not exactly earth-shattering.  In the last year, I&rsquo;ve seen two startups execute on ideas I&rsquo;d had, and they seem to be having some success, which I find extremely comforting.  I&rsquo;m not trying to claim that I could have had the same success, but clearly, &ldquo;finding an idea&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a limiting factor.</p>

<p>So, assuming that my idea will be there when I&rsquo;m ready to work on it, I&rsquo;m saving up to buy myself a year off to work on it, whatever it ends up being.  I&rsquo;ve considered getting a part-time job when the date rolls around, just to bring in enough of a baseline income to pay a few bills without sapping my creativity too much.  In a way, it&rsquo;s a bit like creating an angel investor, one who believes in me 100% and is 100% committed to my success like no one else ever could be.</p>

<p>I realize that this plan is a bit risky.  The risk is laziness.  A dream without execution has a funny way of staying a dream forever.  But I&rsquo;ve made plans like this in the past, and have managed to be ready when the time came to act.  That&rsquo;s how I got to California, after all.</p>

<p>The real challenge is that I&rsquo;m really not sure exactly what a year costs.  I can sit down and crunch numbers, but everything seems way off.  I don&rsquo;t have nearly enough hard data about my lifestyle, and even less about what it <em>could</em> be.  Depending on how I spin my estimates, the range ends up being about ±50% or so, which is useless.</p>

<p>I know that I can live cheaper than I am, but I&rsquo;m not sure which things ought to be cut, and which things are worth the cost.  Maybe coffee is worth $1.46, but not $1.55, when balanced against the PITA of brewing it myself and the joy I get from drinking it, multiplied by the number of cups of coffee I buy.  I&rsquo;m not sure.  I do know that, while nicotine is a pleasure I deeply enjoy, there&rsquo;s really no way to justify the physical and financial cost, and withdrawal will be a serious distraction.  So, I&rsquo;ve been wearing a patch&mdash;and breathing easier&mdash;since June 1, 2008.</p>

<p>A wise man once said, <q>Never optimize before you profile.</q>  <small>Then he said it again and again, because no one seems to listen.</small>  When it comes to optimization, our intuitions and guesswork are almost always wrong, and only hard data can be trusted.  For the last few months, I&rsquo;ve been tracking my expenses using <a href="http://mint.com">mint.com</a> and trying to just &ldquo;act naturally&rdquo;.  Over the next 6 months, I hope to collect enough information about my habits to make wise adjustments.</p>

<p>The 6 months after that will be spent living-as-if, and trying to strike a workable balance.  Considering that I make more than double the national household average, and don&rsquo;t have any kids, I should be able to save enough within 2 years to be able to coast for at least a year, if I just make a concerted effort to stop pissing away so much of it, even at SFBay prices.</p>

<h3>Advice Welcome</h3>

<p>This sort of plan flies in the face of the white-knuckle hardcore hacker work ethic that seems so prevalent in the startup culture of Silicon Valley.  In a way, this is just a rationalization for wimping out.  Why put it off until my 30s when I could take that leap of faith now?  The way I see it, if a bus is coming along later, why run?</p>

<p>It strikes me as foolish and irresponsible to throw away the opportunity that Yahoo gives me just because I have a distaste for being an employee.  (The fact that I have a non-trivial pile of stocks vesting at the end of next year speaks to the wisdom of procrastination, as well.)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t suspect that Foo Hack really draws in the financial planner crowd, but if anyone has any suggestions or experience that might help in the temporary-retirement project, I&rsquo;d love to hear it.  Is this crazy?  Am I going about this all wrong?  Have you ever done anything like this?</p>
