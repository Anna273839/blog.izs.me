<h2>Phases of Database Love</h2>
<h3>Infatuation</h3>

<p>This database is just what I&rsquo;ve been looking for!  It has all the features I need!  It&rsquo;s open source, actively maintained, and the documentation is so extensive!</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to put it into production! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>

<h3>Self Doubt</h3>

<p>Hm.  Well, the first approach to building my app with this thing didn&rsquo;t quite go as I&rsquo;d expected, but that&rsquo;s just because I didn&rsquo;t fully understand its advanced model.  There sure is a lot of documentation, but I don&rsquo;t understand most of it.  Some people in the IRC channel scolded me for thinking in terms of queries, and they&rsquo;re probably right.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve checked out some books, and I&rsquo;m reading a lot about the finer points on the internet.  Everyone using this thing is really smart, so I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve thought this through.</p>

<p>Now that I am starting to get it, though, I see that I was going about my app all wrong.  Once I rewrite it in the complete opposite shape I had before, it&rsquo;ll be great.</p>

<h3>Codependency</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s in production.  My app is holding up, but it takes a few more servers than I would&rsquo;ve hoped.  At this point, I&rsquo;ve worked around so many of this thing&rsquo;s issues that I can&rsquo;t easily migrate off of it, but each new version that comes out seems to make things a little better.</p>

<p>A few of the APIs are kinda confusing, but I know how they work, and I&rsquo;ve mostly forgotten SQL in favor of its fancy DSL thing.  I can kind of work out what the crash dumps mean now, so that&rsquo;s good.</p>

<p>This is fine.  I am ok with how things are proceeding.</p>

<h3>Rage</h3>

<p>Fuck this thing.  I&rsquo;m spending all my money on servers and all my time on debugging bullshit.  I never had this problem with my last database.  Someone remind me what the fuck was so bad about SQL again?  This &ldquo;community&rdquo; here is just a bunch of neckbeards beating up on hapless n00bs, and I can&rsquo;t figure out which group is more annoying.  The docs are garbage, they&rsquo;re a year out of date, and no one has time to edit them, because the first team (which has fucked off doing YET ANOTHER DATABASE now!  in HASKELL because apparently erlang isn&rsquo;t exotic enough these days!) was so overly enthusiastic about their fucking math project that they wrote more about this ugly baby than the combined works of shakespeare and the gutenberg bible put together, so the docs are highly available, not even remotely consistent, and completely fucking partitioned.  Issues in GitHub say to post them into the project Jira, and bugs in Jira are closed for being assigned to the wrong Story, so I spend half my time tracking down a core maintainer to send a patch to.  I&rsquo;m running a cobbled-together patch-floating garbage barge that sinks every time there&rsquo;s an update.</p>

<p>Fuck this thing.  Never again.  I&rsquo;d stop maintaining it and rebuild it all from scratch if I could afford the downtime.</p>

<h3>Familial Acceptance</h3>

<p>Ok.  I&rsquo;ve rewritten half the app as an SOA, and I&rsquo;m just storing data in the database now.  It&rsquo;s still the main source of truth, but the records all get piped over to a SQL relational database that I can actually run queries against.  It has one or two really nice features, and I&rsquo;m using those.  As long as you ignore most of the API, and never read the docs, it&rsquo;s not so bad.</p>

<p>Kinda like that one weird uncle who gets too drunk and rants about the second amendment, but is ok as long as you just meet in public and keep it short.  We all have our faults.  Uncle Bob&rsquo;s a pretty nice guy, overall.  Helped me build a gokart once.</p>

<blockquote><p>So, my original goal was to portray a society that genuinely did not care about gender. Using a single pronoun for everyone was just one part of that, but the more I played with it, the more interesting the effect was. Ultimately, of course, using “she” for everyone doesn’t actually convey gender neutrality, and I realized that pretty quickly. But I think if I’d chosen to use a gender neutral pronoun—e, or sie, or zie, or any of the others—it would have produced an interesting effect, but it would have lost the way that “she” automatically goes straight to the reader’s perceptions. No, that’s not the best way to say it. I mean, the very long familiarity long-time English speakers have with the pronouns “he” and “she” means that we react to them without actually thinking much about it. We don’t stop to ask ourselves what they mean, they just go right in and trigger a particular set of associations, almost automatically, unconsciously. By using “she” for everyone, I get (for many, but of course not all readers) the effect, once those associations are triggered, of undermining or questioning them, in a very basic way, a sort of… experiential way. It’s one thing to tell someone about the masculine default, and have them understand the idea. It’s another thing to actually demonstrate how it works on your reader. But it only works (for the readers it worked for, because of course it didn’t work for everyone) because we parse those pronouns so thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>The various gender neutral pronouns don’t have that long familiarity for most of us. The effect I mention above, which quite a few readers have explicitly commented on and appreciated, would have been lost if I’d used one of them. It was a trade-off, I think. I can’t blame folks who wish I’d used a gender neutral pronoun instead, of course, and I’m hoping to see those pronouns used more so that they become more generally familiar. I’m seeing singular “they” for known people (instead of the nebulous “don’t know who this might actually be” use of singular they) used well in short fiction lately, and I’ve been really happy to see it. But myself, for this particular project, I think the effect that I got, at least with a sizable number of readers, was worth the trade-off.</p>

<p>So, in some ways I succeeded. In other ways I didn’t. But the result was interesting and gave a lot of people something to think about and discuss, and I’m glad of that.</p></blockquote>

<h2>National Coming Out Day</h2>
<p><a href="http://amaditalks.tumblr.com/post/130945796468/national-coming-out-day" class="tumblr_blog">amaditalks</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some points to consider:

</p><ul><li>being out is <b>never an obligation</b></li>
<li>being out is not an indicator of pride, courage, strength, or anything other than a person’s decision to be out</li>
<li>being out is often a major risk, and coming out and staying out is often a mark of privilege to which not everyone has access</li>
<li>being out isn’t always universal, a person can be out to some people and not others, or in some places not others</li>
<li>consequently, never assume that because someone is out to you, they’re out to <b>anyone</b> else</li>
<li>and, it should go without saying, never ever out anyone</li>
<li>lastly, the language of “coming out” belongs to gender and sexual minorities, and there is never a time for people to “come out” as anything else, including as an “ally” to LGBTQ people – no appropriating</li></ul></blockquote>
