<h2><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4teoxl/a_final_response_to_the_tell_me_why_trump_is_a/?compact=true">A final response to the "Tell me why Trump is a fascist". • /r/EnoughTrumpSpam</a></h2>
<h2>To my good and kind hearted conservative friends and relatives:</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s always challenging to learn about the history leading up to the Third Reich and Hitler&rsquo;s rise to power. How didn&rsquo;t they see it coming? Why didn&rsquo;t anyone stop him?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s such a horrible series of events that any comparison to it seems not just inaccurate, but an outrageously cruel and inappropriate joke.</p>

<p>However, it is no exaggeration to say that we are in such a situation now, where historians of the future may ask why we didn&rsquo;t stop the rise of a brutal fascist dictator who overturned the rule of law and performed unspeakable evil. Like the Germans who elected Hitler to power, you are good people, but many of you may not see the stakes of your choice or the power to do Good that rests in your hands.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is not just a buffoon. He knows what he&rsquo;s doing, and he&rsquo;s following a script which has been horrifyingly successful numerous times in the past.</p>

<p>I know you probably don&rsquo;t love Hillary. I don&rsquo;t either. But she is not a fascist. Trump will possibly be even worse than Hitler was. Imagine Hitler with the power of nuclear weapons and the modern American military.</p>

<p>Call on your fellow conservatives to answer for Trump&rsquo;s fascism before voting for him. Ask them if they are willing to take their share of the blame for the unspeakable horrors he is explicitly and openly planning.</p>

<p>This is 2016. Everything is recorded, and Trump makes no apologies or excuses for his plans. History will remember that you should have known what you were doing.</p>

<p>They Might Be Giants played a hell of a show at the Berkeley UC Theater. They did two sets (opening for themselves). On the way out I heard some guy say he got the set list and I felt sharp pangs of envy, but I got a picture of it. Which, really, is for the best because all I&rsquo;d do if I&rsquo;d been the one to grab the list is take a picture and then guiltily keep the faded paper for too long and then guiltily throw it away eventually. </p>

<p>A tmbg show is a thing of beauty. Their catalog is so huge, and they&rsquo;re still so prolific, it&rsquo;s a good bet that they&rsquo;ll play a few songs you&rsquo;d forgotten, a few you don&rsquo;t know, a few you just started listening to, and your favorite from a long time ago. And a surprising cover or two. (In this case, it was &ldquo;pay my bills&rdquo; by Destiny&rsquo;s Child.) Plus they&rsquo;re hilarious, and rock stars.  (at The UC Theatre)</p>

<h2><b>Unarmed Black Man With Hands Up Shot By Police.</b></h2>
<p><b>Charles Kinsey, 47, a behavior therapist from South Florida was shot in the leg three times by the police in North Miami while laying on the ground with his arms up and trying to help his patient with autism who had run away from a group home.</b></p>
<p>It all started when someone called 911 and said there was a man walking around with a gun. However it was Kinsey’s patient who was sitting on the ground cross-legged, playing with a toy truck.</p>
<h2>Charles got shot by police despite telling them he was only trying to help his patient.</h2>
<p><b>The police shot him, handcuffed him and left him on ground bleeding.</b></p>
<p>North Miami police have not released much information at
all. They haven’t released the officer’s name, they haven’t given us an update
on the investigation. However, they did say that the state attorney is now a part of
this investigation.</p>

<h2>Among the Many Hardest Problems in Computer Science Are Such Things As...</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a saying that the two hardest problems in computer science are caching, naming things, and off-by-one errors.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s just one hard problem: asynchronously shared state.  The others are all instances of it.</p>

<p>Race conditions can only happen when processing happens in multiple places, and they become even more complicated when information is updated by multiple actors and stored in multiple places.</p>

<p>You read a thing from disk, do some stuff to it, write back the result.  Except, while you&rsquo;re doing stuff to the information, some other process reads the same file, does some different stuff to it, and writes its result back.  Whoever takes the longest wins, the other&rsquo;s write is gone.</p>

<p>Where this is more complicated is when the processing is done in human brains, which are notoriously hard to observe, operate in massively parallel fashion, and have extremely distributed and unreliable data storage capabilities.</p>

<p>What do we call this thing?  Is it a cache, or a copy?  A read-through cache?  How often should it be purged?  If it&rsquo;s a copy, is it authoritative?  When does it get synced back?  The problem is not just that words have meaning, but that they have so many meanings.</p>

<p>A word like &ldquo;specification&rdquo; can mean &ldquo;hard and fast set of rules which explicitly limit the scope of work&rdquo; to one person, and &ldquo;the beginning of a conversation which points at the intent of a feature&rdquo; to someone else.  They&rsquo;re probably going to have some unproductive arguments about whether a thing &ldquo;satisfies the spec&rdquo; or not.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s just when we&rsquo;re talking about simple things like programming.  Start getting into conflict or culture or strategy, and holy moly, it&rsquo;s so much harder.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to say that the solution is &ldquo;more communication&rdquo;, but more <em>bad</em> communication can make the situation worse, and even good communication has a cost.  &ldquo;So write it down!&rdquo; I say to myself in my internal argument, wherein I attempt to reconcile the state I share among the many processes across my brain.  Ok, but write <em>what</em> down?  Where?  How often do you read it back again?  Does anyone know where it&rsquo;s written?  Is it authoritative or suggestive?  How does one edit it when the situation changes?</p>

<p>Turns out hard things are hard.  My past self often assumed that something would not be so hard, and my current self now has to reconcile the new experience of hardness with the cached value of expected ease.</p>

<p>Shared state.  It&rsquo;s one hell of a fucker.  The only easy thing is solipsism, but then it&rsquo;s hard to get much done on your own, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>On each in-breath, I hold the first word.  On the out breath, I hold the second word, and bring the feeling of that concept to the part of my body referenced (head, eyes, mouth/throat, heart, gut).</p>

<p>I try to consider that each term is both an adjective, and thus a thing to aspire to (a True Heart, an Open Vision, etc.) as well as a verb instructing me how to attain that state.</p>

<p>When I notice my mind has wanderd, I try to pick up where I left off, or back at the beginning.</p>

<p>This is how I&rsquo;ve been going to sleep lately, unless I&rsquo;m too tired to do anything but breath counting.  When I have time, I try to go through it in the shower as well.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s making me a better person, but it feels good to remind myself that I aspire to be curious, capable, and compassionate.</p>
