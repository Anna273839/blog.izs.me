<h2>NodeJS and Empowering n00bz</h2>
<p>Something interesting occurred to me today about why I like NodeJS so much, and why I got so into it as soon as I started playing with it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not the fact that it&rsquo;s fast (it could be a <em>lot</em> slower before it would start to matter), or that I have strong feelings about IO being async (it should be, of course, but I mean, whatever, threads work), or that JavaScript is so great (I like it, but there were other JS platforms out there that were more advanced in a lot of ways).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s that it was so easy to just download the source, run a command, and have something that works, right away.  The example programs are simple, and short, and clear in what they do.  When I first started poking at the source code, the mapping from the &ldquo;lib&rdquo; folder to the &ldquo;require&rdquo; function was easy to grok.</p>

<p>Empowering newcomers is the key to success.  That matters more than anything else.  I saw the simplicity in what Ryan was trying to do, and that was a huge indicator of future success.  Even the &ldquo;commonjs be damned, we&rsquo;re gonna do what&rsquo;s right and let the standards follow&rdquo; attitude has kept things lean and simple.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked on a lot of different projects.  I like new things, and that means I&rsquo;ve been the new guy for most of my career in software development, professionally and recreationally.  Going from empty folder to running program in a few simple steps is a HUGE accomplishment that many professional software teams really struggle with, and that struggle costs a lot of wasted time and energy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen people post to the NodeJS list asking questions as they&rsquo;re comparing node to other platforms, and a week later, they&rsquo;re publishing modules and add-ons and contributing code and tests and docs back to the core.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s huge.</p>
