<h2><a href="http://shanecroucher.co.uk/2009/08/29/most-twitter-users-are-atheists-according-to-poll/">Most Twitter users are atheists, according to poll.</a></h2>
<p>This is interesting.  Sadly, as an opt-in poll, it suffers from the most obvious and extreme selection bias, and raises more questions than it answers.</p>

<p>Does it suggest that atheists are most likely to use twitter?  Or perhaps that, without religion, we look elsewhere for silly memes, and thus are more susceptible to polls and the like?  Perhaps this higher memetic availability explains why more atheists might be using twitter in the first place.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s really just a measurement of religiousity in the Bay Area and a few other places where twitter is popular.</p>

<p>Hard to say.</p>

<p>Netflix is Doing It Right.</p>

<p>This is how employees should be treated, and how creative knowledge-based companies should be run.</p>

<p>Given that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html">short-term incentives motivate far less effectively than a sense of control and ownership</a>, isn&rsquo;t it time that businesses start using what science knows to make their employees more productive?</p>

<p>If I ever go to another BDC after I&rsquo;m done at Yahoo, I&rsquo;ll take a good long look at Netflix.  Now I understand why engineers who go there and seem so happy.</p>

<p>Dan Ariely talks about a few of the ways in which we demonstrate that we don&rsquo;t know why we do the things we do.  Key takeaway: when picking up strangers, bring someone who looks just like you, but just a <em>little</em> uglier.</p>

<h2>Into</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference between these three states:</p>

<ol><li>I like X</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m into X</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m good at X</li>
</ol><p>That difference usually amounts to doing whatever it is.  A lot.  But, if you like something, it&rsquo;s hard to admit you&rsquo;re not really into it in any meaningful way.  Maybe you like the beliefs behind open source code, and you admire the people who do it, and think of yourself as one of them.  But you don&rsquo;t actually <em>do</em> it.</p>

<p>The first step to getting good at anything worthwhile is accepting that you&rsquo;re going to suck at it, most likely for a <em>very</em> long time.  If you can master it in a day, it&rsquo;s probably not all that interesting.  The really cool stuff takes years.</p>

<p>So get started, already.</p>

<h2>Holidays</h2>
<p>There are four holidays in my religion. They match the seasons, and are balanced and symmetrical. As far as I know, there are at least 2 people other than myself that observe all 4 of these holidays as they&rsquo;re intended.</p>

<h2>Consumptive Holidays</h2>

<blockquote><p>Moderation is for monks. Take big bites.</p></blockquote>

<div class="source"><cite>Lazarus Long</cite></div>

<p><strong>Autumn: Thanksgiving</strong> - Food. OMG food. Everyone get together, with family or friends or strangers, and eat a lot. Wine, turkey, corn, gravy, potatoes, pastries, berries, pumpkins and squashes, ham, whateveryoucanfitinyourfaceuntilyourbeltpops. It&rsquo;s not about family, it&rsquo;s not about pilgrims and indians or turkeys, it&rsquo;s about feasting until you have to lay down.</p>

<p>Then sleep. Take Friday off for more sleeping.</p>

<p><strong>Spring: 4/20</strong> - April 20th is the Thanksgiving of the spring. It&rsquo;s not cold, and there&rsquo;s no need to stuff your face. Instead, stuff your head. Go outside, celebrate the beauty of nature all around you. Explore new areas in your world and your mind. Have fun with it! See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_(cannabis_culture)">420</a>.</p>

<h2>Reflective Holidays</h2>

<blockquote><p>The Unexamined Life is Not Worth Living</p></blockquote>

<div class="source"><cite>Socrates</cite></div>

<p><strong>Winter: Christmas</strong> - From December 21st-ish until January 1, we meet with family. Bake sweet foods, and play with evergreens, and do other things that smell lovely. Eventually, there&rsquo;s a big dinner, and presents. The presents used to be the big draw for me, but now, they&rsquo;re just kind of a hassle. I spend a bunch of money on things that my family doesn&rsquo;t need, and get a bunch of stuff that I didn&rsquo;t really want. But wrapping and unwrapping things is fun, and the surprise of it can be enjoyable.</p>

<p>On Christmas, I reflect on my family, and my place in the tribe. We all come together, and it&rsquo;s a very social thing. Old animosities are stirred up, as are old loves and childhood memories. It connects us to our shared past, and adds warmth to the winter.</p>

<p><strong>Summer: Birthday</strong> - On July 1, we take a day off to reflect on the last year of life, and think about where it&rsquo;s going next. Instead of buying presents for other people, we focus on what we really want for ourselves, and measure the progress that is so often forgotten in our day-to-day business. It&rsquo;s a primarily solitary activity, but it&rsquo;s also an excuse to party.</p>

<p>The fact that I was actually born on Birthday is inconsequential. Birthday is for everyone. For each of us, it&rsquo;s a celebration of the fact that we are present and alive in this world, and a day when we can take a moment to see how we&rsquo;re doing and consider if there are any course changes we might want to make. Most of all, it&rsquo;s a day to reward ourselves for what we&rsquo;ve accomplished, and thus provide greater motivation for more accomplishment.</p>

<h2>Consumptive vs Reflective</h2>

<p>None of these holidays are better or more important than any of the others. The interesting thing is that, by coming together and consuming, we bond and find commonalities. By reflecting and meditating on one&rsquo;s place in the universe and in our tribe, we often find cause for feasting.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a value in focusing on one aspect or another, just for a day, just to make sure we don&rsquo;t forget.</p>

<p>The incomplete life is the life not worth living.</p>

<h2>Loyalty</h2>
<p>Send up the red flags and alarms whenever you hear this word. 10&rsquo;ll get you 20, it&rsquo;s a scam of some sort.  Sniff around.</p>

<p>There are only two things to be loyal to in this world: your self, and your integrity. And usually, if you lose one, the other goes along with it.</p>

<p>If any other &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; seems to collide with those two—family, party, country, job, what-have-you—you&rsquo;re in trouble. Drop it like a bad habit. Run fast. That ship is sinking.</p>

<p>In other words, &ldquo;I got only two things in this world: my word, and my balls. And I don&rsquo;t break ’em for nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>The returning good sense of our country threatens abortion to <ins>[the Christian churches’]</ins> hopes, &amp; they believe that any portion of power confided to me, will be exerted in opposition to their schemes. <strong>And they believe rightly; for I have sworn upon the altar of god, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.</strong> But this is all they have to fear from me: &amp; enough too in their opinion, &amp; this is the cause of their printing lying pamphlets against me, forging conversations for me <a href="#tj-cite-1">[1]</a></p>

<hr><p><strong>Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion.</strong> The several sects perform the office of a <i lang="lat">Censor morum</i> over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned: yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. <strong>What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites.</strong> To support roguery and error all over the earth. <a href="#tj-cite-2">[2]</a></p>

<hr><p>The rights of conscience we never submitted, we could not submit. We are answerable for them to our God. The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. <strong>But it does me no injury for my neighbour to say there are twenty gods, or no god.</strong> It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. … <strong>Reason and free enquiry are the only effectual agents against error.</strong> <a href="#tj-cite-2">[2]</a></p>

<hr><p>Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion. <strong>Question with boldness even the existence of a god;</strong> because, if there be one, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear. <a href="#tj-cite-3">[3]</a></p>

<hr><p>And the day will come when <strong>the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.</strong> But we may hope that the dawn of reason and freedom of thought in these United States will do away all this artificial scaffolding, and restore to us the primitive and genuine doctrines of this the most venerated reformer of human errors. <a href="#tj-cite-4">[4]</a></p>

<hr><p>In fact <ins>[the Holy Trinity]</ins> is so incomprehensible to the human mind that no candid man can say he has any idea of it, and how can he believe what presents no idea. <strong>He who thinks he does only decieves himself.</strong> He proves also that <strong>man, once surrendering his reason, has no remaining guard against absurdities the most monstrous</strong>, and like a ship without rudder is the sport of every wind. With such persons gullability which they call faith takes the helm from the hand of reason and the mind becomes a wreck. [sic] <a href="#tj-cite-5">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>Atheism and Groupthink </h2>
<p>Get ready, I&rsquo;m about to offend almost everyone. (Except atheists.) Chasing the TeaL DeeR&hellip;</p>

<p>Having a firm belief in a &ldquo;higher power&rdquo; smelled funny to me from a pretty early age. I could never find any non-contradictory evidence, and it seemed like a pretty fantastic set of ideas to buy into. I guess you could say that I was a soft atheist (aka agnostic) as early as 10 years old, and my acceptance of God gradually faded as I learned to distinguish reality from fiction.</p>

<p>The thing that struck me as very odd around that time is that I started to realize that other people – adults – they <em>actually believed this shit</em>. When my grandmother told me that Santa lives in the North Pole, and when she told me that Jesus lives in Heaven, I heard two statements that were in roughly the same category. But for her, one was make-believe, and the other history. Between 10 and 12, this very strange cognitive dissonance started to dawn on me, and it troubled me greatly.</p>

<p>Also around that time, I realized that people didn&rsquo;t just <em>believe</em> in God; they formed <em>teams</em> around what they believed about God, and they based their lives around it. I had friends who were Protestants, and they didn&rsquo;t have to go to Catechism after school. I had other friends who were Jewish, and they had Chanukah instead of Christmas. (Some of them had Christmas too, and Santa.)</p>

<p>Luckily for me, my parents were kind of hippies, despite (or maybe because of) both being brought up Catholic. My dad is the kind of atheist that we&rsquo;d all be if there was no such thing as religion. He just doesn&rsquo;t think about it, doesn&rsquo;t talk about it, doesn&rsquo;t care about it. He is spiritual, but God isn&rsquo;t involved even a little. My mother calls herself a Christian, but doesn&rsquo;t affiliate herself with any particular denomination. She believes in &ldquo;some kind of higher power&rdquo;, but she thought it was important for us to &ldquo;find our own paths and learn about ourselves&rdquo; and all that jazz.</p>

<p>Turns out, &ldquo;find your own path and form your own belief&rdquo; is a good way to ensure your kid is an atheist. If they&rsquo;re not in the fold by 21, they&rsquo;re probably lost for good.</p>

<p>So, in middle school and high school, when kids normally start identifying with various teams and forming their sense of self around labels, I became very curious about religion. I knew that there was something deeply wrong with my grandmother&rsquo;s fervent Catholicism, but I really didn&rsquo;t get why someone would believe those things. I figured I must be missing something.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s stupid. That&rsquo;s really all there is to it. But religion&rsquo;s unique <em>kind</em> of stupid is important, and it wasn&rsquo;t until a few years later that I saw it.</p>

<p>We are not solitary animals. A lone human is like a lone ant—not long for this world. Evolutionary biology has a funny way of imbuing us with instincts and ideas and feelings that help ensure survival and crush our rivals in the dangerous time of our near-extinction. However, in modern times, when those feelings no longer make sense, we still have them. Sex feels good, even when you&rsquo;re not procreating. Fat tastes good, even when you don&rsquo;t need to hoard calories. And so on.</p>

<p>These ideas about God and Jesus and the Bible and whatnot, I realized, got into peoples&rsquo; heads just to keep them in the group. I realized this in high school, and it was a pretty pivotal point in my spiritual growth.</p>

<p>I was at a concert when I had this revelation, for a local band in New Haven that wasn&rsquo;t very good, called the Venus Vixens. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t very good&rdquo; is quite generous. I went outside because they were so unbearably terrible. I would have left if I&rsquo;d been old enough to have driven there. I started to wonder why I&rsquo;d come and paid money for this band I couldn&rsquo;t stand.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t claim ignorance, either. I knew I couldn&rsquo;t stand them before I&rsquo;d agreed to go, because I&rsquo;d heard one of their tapes already! And when a friend of mine asked if I wanted to come with them, and if I liked the band, I <em>lied and said that I thought they were good!</em> I&rsquo;d heard the words coming out of my mouth, and had thought, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re terrible. What the fuck am I doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Interestingly enough, The Offspring were the opening band, and they were even worse back then than they are now. A few years later when I saw them on MTV, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it.)</p>

<p>So there I was, standing on Center Street outside the Tune Inn, walking to the Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts on the corner to pass the time until the show was over, wondering about why I was such a damned putz. The humbling fact was apparent: I&rsquo;d claimed a fact that was untrue about myself solely to belong to a group of people. And we were the freaks and nerds, the outcasts! We were supposed to be ok with being different, for crying out loud!</p>

<p>The second worst social attack that one teenager can use against another is to make them seem like they&rsquo;re not part of the group. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the same zoodads that we like. You&rsquo;re not one of us.&rdquo; The pressure to like the same things that the group likes is powerful, subconscious, and instinctual. It is the most primal glue that bonds us, and as children, we aren&rsquo;t sophisticated to have any other kind.</p>

<p>So, the <em>worst</em> insult that one teenager can lay on another is that of &ldquo;poser&rdquo;, someone who pretends to like something even though they don&rsquo;t really. That&rsquo;s like calling someone an outsider and a traitor all at once. This is such a damaging insult, such a vicious slur against one&rsquo;s character, that most kids would do almost anything to send the signals that they are genuine in their appreciation for the band, or the style, or whatever.</p>

<p>When you pretend to believe something, and pretend diligently enough, you&rsquo;ll start to really believe it. Sitting there in Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts with some muttering crackhead in downtown New Haven outside an unlistenable punk show, I realized that the only argument for believing in God is that you&rsquo;ll have friends who believe the same things you do, just like my alleged appreciation for the Venus Vixens had brought me to a terrible punk show. It kinda grossed me out to see that in myself.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot of philosophy. I&rsquo;ve learned about the infinity paradoxes. I&rsquo;ve learned about the problems with the ontological &ldquo;proof&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve learned about Pascal&rsquo;s Wager, and shown its failure in a variety of different ways. I&rsquo;ve learned about the formal and technical applications of Occam&rsquo;s Razer. I&rsquo;ve learned about spirituality and meditation. I&rsquo;ve taken a wide array of psychotropic drugs (and it wasn&rsquo;t experimentation most of the time, I knew <em>exactly</em> what would happen). I&rsquo;ve learned about the history of the Bible. I&rsquo;ve studied the space teacups and the flying spaghetti monsters. I&rsquo;ve read Dawkins and Harris and Rand and Russel. I&rsquo;ve learned about evolution and cosmology.</p>

<p>There is no need for God. In fact, it raises a lot more problems that it solves. It is my belief that &ldquo;friends who believe&rdquo; remains the solitary compelling reason that people can and do convince themselves to believe in a higher power. There&rsquo;s more to it, of course. There&rsquo;s agent fixation, and the tendency of children to believe just about <em>anything</em> their elders tell them, and a bunch of other cognitive mistakes that are usually evolutionarily advantageous. But groupthink seems like the biggest contender.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t accept a belief just because it&rsquo;s what the crowd believes. That kind of idea—and more importantly, that method of choosing ideas—while perhaps important for our ancestors, is dangerous, wrong, and <em>evil</em>. If anything, I tend to be especially suspicious of the things that &ldquo;everybody knows,&rdquo; precisely because they tend to get less criticism, so we need to make the extra effort.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very confident that there is no God, no woowoo energies, no angels and fairies and devils, no afterlife, no unicorns, no super powers. That being said, I have a lot of respect for many different kinds of cognitive distortions. In a previous post, I wrote about the concept of &ldquo;energy&rdquo; or &ldquo;chi&rdquo; – sometimes the model might be wrong, but the phenomenon may still be worth investigating.</p>

<p>Groupthink is never ok, and it is an insidious error. By comparison, I can definitely respect someone for stopping at agnosticism. I&rsquo;ve seen two common arguments for agnosticism; one is defensible in my opinion, the other is not.</p>

<h2>1. It seems possible to me that &hellip;</h2>

<p>A lot of things might seem possible that in fact aren&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Possibility&rdquo; is a statement about our mental model, not a statement about the universe. It &ldquo;seemed possible&rdquo; to the writers, cast, and many viewers of CSI that the line <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=create+a+gui+interface+using+visual+basic%2C+see+if+i+can+track+an+IP+address">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll create a GUI interface using VisualBasic, see if I can track an IP address&rdquo;</a> was a reasonable thing that a computer hacker might say about tracking down a criminal. As a programmer, I laughed my ass off.</p>

<p>Not everyone has time to burn on studying the arguments for and against. And expertise is hard to come by on this topic. Many apparent experts are clearly quacks, and many others disagree with one another, so who should you believe? And really, how much does it matter? Not having an opinion on the subject of God is rational, just as it&rsquo;s rational to not have an opinion on &ldquo;GUI interfaces using VisualBasic&rdquo; that are used to &ldquo;track an IP address&rdquo;. There are plenty of important topics that I have no opinion about, or where I&rsquo;ll freely admit that my opinion is mostly useless.</p>

<h2>2. It&rsquo;s not a black and white issue.</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s a bit of malarky, if you ask me. Either there is a God or there isn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve never gotten a straight answer on how this really could make sense, and I suspect that it&rsquo;s a softer form of social-think. In other words, it translates to &ldquo;God doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me, but I&rsquo;m not quite sure I want to anger the other apes, so I&rsquo;m taking a less controversial position.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this &ldquo;absolutes are bad&rdquo; ideology taken to extreme (and self-defeating!) zealotry. I&rsquo;ve been told that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;just as bad as religious fundamentalists&rdquo; because of my atheism. (Really? <em>Just as bad?</em> How many atheists kill their daughters for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of having been raped, or blow up abortion clinics, or prevent life-saving medical treatments for their children?)</p>

<p>Gray-worship is deeply problematic. &ldquo;Undecided&rdquo; is the place to be when ignorant and without a trustworthy expert. But the avoidance of firm opinions because they are firm is foolish, and equating all firm opinions as equally wrong is a wild perversion of &ldquo;open mindedness&rdquo;. I usually try to point out the contradictory nature of this fundamentalist anti-fundamentalism. I don&rsquo;t buy the premise that &ldquo;all ideas are fuzzy except this one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This might strike some as improper or overly harsh: if you are religious, at least in the traditional western sense, and serious about it, then I could probably never date you, and even our level of friendship would be capped somewhere just above &ldquo;friendly acquaintance&rdquo; at best. It&rsquo;s not that I have any disdain for religious people. I try not to blame the victim, since many of these mistakes are so very easy to slip into. This is a prediction more than a prescription. We just won&rsquo;t click.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not about having to agree; in fact, some of my best friends are agnostic, and many of them have very different ideas about a lot of things than I do. If anything, it&rsquo;s about being able to disagree. That&rsquo;s another problem with gray worship: if there are no absolutes, then we can&rsquo;t disagree, can we?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s not &ldquo;agree to disagree&rdquo;; instead, let&rsquo;s <em>actually disagree</em>, and chew on it. If you&rsquo;re not willing and able to think &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; thoughts, to collide ideas against one another, then where&rsquo;s the growth? If some ideas are off-limits, then where&rsquo;s the innovation? If that&rsquo;s not your cup of tea, we probably just won&rsquo;t get along.</p>

<p>We all occasionally hide from our true selves under the warm blanket of the hive mind. But as responsible rational animals, we ought to strive to be vigilant against this distortion, and eagerly cut through that blanket whenever we notice it. When we hide from our true selves, we are living less fully.</p>

<p>Living less fully means being less alive.</p>

<h2>The Calm of Exertion</h2>
<p>Exerted and spent, and yet filled up and satisfied.<br/>
Like a cat in the sun.<br/>
It is work that brings this calm, strengthens the body and mind for another round.<br/>
This is the reward of your effort.<br/><strong>Do not squander it!</strong></p>

<p>How often have I burnt myself out, and felt so overwhelmed, like there was never enough time, never enough of me to cover all the corners, spread and stretched as a sheet over too large a bed, butter across too much bread, thin and weary, cracking and torn, pulled to shreds.  So many times I&rsquo;ve forgotten this lesson, forgotten to pick up my reward, and paid the price for it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve told myself that work is to blame.  I point the finger at the likely suspect, but the fact of the matter is that <em>I</em> was to blame, and didn&rsquo;t want to admit I&rsquo;d caused my own pain.</p>

<p>There is plenty of time.<br/>
Everyone will get by just fine.</p>

<p>Work hard, and rest deeply.  That is the Key.</p>

<h2>Fear of Failure</h2>
<p>Todo:</p>

<p>Once per month, or as often as possible, find an error in judgement that I made in the past—something I really and truly believed and fought for, which was 100% wrong—and publicly announce it.  It&rsquo;s gotta sting.</p>

<p>The goal is to build up a thick skin against the fear of failure.  Failure is natural, it is a learning process, and important.  Resisting the information that comes with failure is disastrous.  And fear of failure is a mind-killer.  My ego might not like doing this, but sometimes you just have to tell your ego to grow a pair.</p>

<p>The first one is a gimme: getting married was a horrifically bad idea.  There&rsquo;s no excuse for it.  It&rsquo;s an outdated institution, but beyond that, we were just a terrible couple.  I wasn&rsquo;t happy.  I should have broken up with her, and instead I proposed.  I have defended the decision countless times, even while going through our separation and divorce, because of a fear of admitting to my family and friends and myself that I was just flat-out wrong on many levels.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that any mistake I make in business or in life will ever be as painful, expensive, or full of public fail.  And yet here I am, happy and successful.  So there is really no reason to fear anything.  I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from that failure, about myself, and about love, and about what I need to be happy.</p>

<p>Admitting failure can be exhilarating.  Try it!</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/3801577000/"><strong>“fuck |fək| vulgar slang”</strong></a></p>

  <p>I can’t believe the vulgarity in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/apps-and-utilities.html#dictionary" rel="nofollow">Apple’s OS X Dictionary</a>.</p>
  
  <p>As we speak, millions of OS X users have no idea there’s an “<b>eff word</b>” right on their Mac. Right there. <i>In their home</i>. Where their spouse sleeps. Where their children play with their toys.</p>
  
  <p>When will Apple finally clean up its act? When will they learn?</p>
  
  <p>People don’t buy computers to explore the world or learn what things mean; they buy computers to rent PIXAR movies and order iPhones. They certainly don’t buy them to see trash like this. No, sir.</p>
  
  <p>Shame, Apple. <i>Shame</i>.</p>
  
  <p>Please take all the words off my computer.</p>

<h2><a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Autism-as-Academic-Paradigm/47033/">Autism as Academic Paradigm</a></h2>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;re also learning that a lot of the stereotypes about autistics are false or at least misleading. It&rsquo;s been suggested, for instance, that autistics don&rsquo;t care much about other people, or that autistics lack genuine emotions or are incapable of empathy. The more likely truth is that autistics and nonautistics do not always understand each other very well. It&rsquo;s odd that the people who make this charge so often, in the very act of doing so, fail to show much empathy for autistics or to recognize their rich emotional lives. Even when the cognitive capabilities of autistics are recognized —most commonly in the cases of savants —it is too often accompanied by a clichéd and inaccurate picture of a cold, robotic, or less than human personality.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article1084093.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1246357554256">If you want to be rich, first stop being so frightened</a></h2>
<p>Good quote: &ldquo;If you are unwilling to fail, sometimes publicly, and even catastrophically, you stand little chance of ever getting rich.&rdquo; Reminds me of this quote from Lazarus Long: &ldquo;People who go broke in a big way never miss any meals. It is the poor jerk who is shy a half slug who must tighten his belt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a bit of a pod who sometimes finds it all too easy to &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; my human concerns, and an on-again-off-again workaholic who was literally ridiculed by my friends for my study and work habits, I am very inspired by what he has to say.</p>
