<h2>Companies, Don't Eat Your Brains</h2>
<p>Until recently, I was spending a lot of time building <a href="http://pirates.yahoo.com">one</a> <a href="http://harrypotter.yahoo.com">brand site</a> <a href="http://gta.yahoo.com">after</a> <a href="http://starwars.yahoo.com">another</a>.  There&rsquo;s nothing at all wrong about making a big deal and then building a one-off site.  <abbr title="Yahoo">We</abbr> were making money doing this, and making money is what a company is, ultimately, all about.  Anything else is irresponsible and rather mean to our stockholders.  As a stockholder, I am quite personally vested in Yahoo&rsquo;s financial behavior.</p>

<p>However, as a web developer, our extremely short timelines were rough, and didn&rsquo;t allow any time to re-think the approach and come up with a more sustainable plan.  When the plan was, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do a few of these, and then reevaluate, and build a platform,&rdquo; it was fine.  But <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1030_3-6191768.html">changes in leadership</a> (and accordingly, <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2159788,00.asp">changes in strategy</a>) led to a change in direction for our team.  At least in the near- to mid-term, we would be continuing to build these sorts of (largely, very successful) branded world sites.  After all, if a team of 3 can deliver on a high-six-figure deal in 2 weeks, well, that&rsquo;s the kind of gravy businesses dream about.  Again, as a stockholder and an employee of this company, I think that&rsquo;s great.  But this project certainly didn&rsquo;t scratch my itch as a developer, and the stressful timelines were making me a bit crazy.  I literally had nightmares about these sites.</p>

<p>The problem with working hard on a team of dedicated engineers is that it can be hard to fail.  How can you hope to learn what&rsquo;s wrong with your process, if it keeps working?  <em>Is</em> there anything wrong with a process that keeps delivering on its promises?</p>

<p>Sometimes, yes.  And a good old-fashioned wallop of a failure is traditionally what sets a product back on track.  However, without too much back-patting, the team that I was working on was completely stocked with talented and dedicated engineers who simply would not allow failure to happen, even if it meant working late nights and weekends.  The result?  We worked late nights and weekends, and stressed out over these projects.  This wasn&rsquo;t the project we agreed to work on, and we were getting a bit fed up.  The burn-out was starting to set in.  More than once, my wife got exasperated with me over my lack of enthusiasm about anything.  The body&rsquo;s natural defense against being over-worked is to let all the energy go out of the machine.</p>

<p>Luckily, I work at <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2007/snapshots/44.html">one of the best companies to work for</a>, and the management here always astonishes me.  Despite the <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=yahoo+cube">endless seas of cubes</a>, this is not a Dilbert-esque code factory where engineers&rsquo; souls are systematically crushed.  Starting today, I&rsquo;m working on a new project (which I don&rsquo;t think I can talk about yet, but I will as soon as I can,) and the work of cranking out brand sites is already being distributed in a more sustainable fashion.</p>

<p>A message to companies out there: Don&rsquo;t eat your brains.  Your talented workers are what keep you in business.  It is your responsibility to use them, and push them, and guide them in productive directions.  But don&rsquo;t kill the golden goose.  Yahoo probably extended my employment here considerably, and certainly increased my morale greatly, by just finding something else for me to do.  Just ask them now and then what they want and how they feel about what you&rsquo;re doing, and you&rsquo;ll probably find that they could be even more valuable than they are.</p>

<h2>Broken Mac Wireless Driver in 10.4.10</h2>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: This post is regarding an issue that has since been fixed by Apple.  If you&rsquo;ve run this script, then please run the included undo.sh to reverse the changes, and then get the actual patch from the Software Update command in the Apple Menu.</em></p>

<hr><p>If you&rsquo;ve upgraded to 10.4.10, and you use wireless (who doesn&rsquo;t, these days?) and you work off the battery (why else would you have a laptop?), then you&rsquo;ve probably run into issues with kernel panics and fast-dying batteries.</p>

<p><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1017323&amp;tstart=50">The fix</a> is a bit tricky, and involves finding and downloading 3 different files, and then moving stuff around manually.  Not being able to suffer the thought of doing this by hand, I decided to write a fix that&rsquo;s all packaged up in a single download and one step.</p>

<p>Download <a href="http://foohack.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/10410_wireless_fix.tgz" title="10.4.10 Wireless Fix">the tgz file</a>.  Unpack it, and run <code>install.sh</code>.  It&rsquo;ll create a backup of the files that are touched, and can be easily reverted to said backup with <code>undo.sh</code>.</p>

<p>Enjoy using wireless on battery power, <abbr title="MacBook Pro">MBP</abbr> lovers!</p>

<p><strong>Like it says in the script:</strong> I make <strong>NO</strong> gaurantees about the quality or reliability of this code.  It worked for me, but it might make your machine explode.  <strong class="warning">Use at your own risk!</strong></p>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>Updated the scripts to work when run from Terminal.app.  Sorry for the confusion, guys!</p>

<h2>There's no room for Ego or Zealotry in Software (especially on the web)</h2>
<p>For the last several years, there&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about why web standards are generally a good thing.  And I agree with the vast majority of it.  Writing clean code that sticks to a widely accepted standard is a very good way to help the future programmers who will invariably be touching your stuff once you&rsquo;re gone (or yourself fixing a bug next month or year later.)  In this sense, web standards are a sort of &ldquo;kindness in coding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, as with the <abbr title="object oriented programming">OOP</abbr> zealotry that started 20 years ago and is still going strong today, this set of very useful guidelines has turned into a movement.  It has gained enough followers and momentum, and in many cases, seems to have become and End In Itself.</p>

<p>Movements are like organisms.  They survive because the cells that make them up all continually and unthinkingly chant the mantras and make the arguments.  Ideas can be good.  Critically examining them is good.  Being passionate about a good idea is good.  But movements, more often than not, become problematic.</p>

<p>Software is the most complicated thing that humans build, and we haven&rsquo;t really figured it out.  You could even make the argument that we probably never will fully figure out how to create software in a way that doesn&rsquo;t suck to some degree.  That&rsquo;s not to say we don&rsquo;t create some great software, great websites, great programs, etc.  But there are <em>always</em> bugs, and delays, and general chaos along the way, and I believe that there always will be.  The process involves an unknown number of unknowns.  Software is more complicated than the human brain can handle, and that&rsquo;s the only kind of brain that we have.</p>

<p>So, how do you solve a problem when you don&rsquo;t know all the factors, and only have a vague idea of what success looks like?  It&rsquo;s like climbing a mountain when you can&rsquo;t see the top.  You can still see the slope, and can occasionally get glimpses of where you&rsquo;re going, or at least, you know that it&rsquo;s higher up.  If we are to approach quality software, then we must treat this exceedingly complicated problem in a manner that at least <em>approaches</em> quality heuristically, perhaps organically.</p>

<p>Software is a process of making decisions, and then codifying and saving those decisions.  Bad decisions must be pruned ruthlessly, and good ones must be recognized and reused.  In a general sense, this is the heuristic that leads to quality software (or quality <em>anything</em> for that matter.)  The question of what makes a decision &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is itself a decision that needs continual evaluation.  And <em>that&rsquo;s</em> where movements get into trouble.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to say, <q>If it conforms with the w3c&rsquo;s (or Microsoft&rsquo;s or whoever&rsquo;s) standards, then it&rsquo;s good.</q>  I think that this might be a good start, but it&rsquo;s basically an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority">argument from authority</a>.  The w3c is a group of humans.  So is Microsoft.  Humans make mistakes, and have plenty of limitations; that&rsquo;s why we need a heuristic in the first place.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also easy to say, <q>If it loads fast and looks right, then it&rsquo;s good.</q>  Sure, but how easy is it to debug it when it doesn&rsquo;t work as expected?  Can new developers add to it easily?  Is it expensive to maintain or re-purpose?</p>

<p>Or, even worse, <q>This was written in (Rails, VB, Django, PHP, C#, valid CSS) so it&rsquo;s good.</q>  I think that a lot of the worst examples of Microsoft horrors were the result of a fanatical attachment to Visual Basic.  I&rsquo;ve seen (ok, &ldquo;written&rdquo;) some terrible CSS that was, nonetheless, technically &ldquo;valid&rdquo; according to the W3C&rsquo;s validator.</p>

<p>Sadly, most developers judge decisions based on their feelings rather than any kind of objective analysis.  <q>I wrote this, and it&rsquo;s clever, and it makes me happy, so it&rsquo;s good.</q>  There is no surer way to end up with a pile of garbage than this approach.  It&rsquo;s hard to let go of something that you worked on, and coders are certainly not the only culprits.  I&rsquo;ve seen execs spend countless hours on a deal that never yielded any value for the company, and designers fight tooth and nail for a visual approach that just didn&rsquo;t work.  Hell, we all have a relative or two with a recipe for something that they love, but which everyone knows is terribly bland.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really <em>really</em> hard to let go of this emotional attachment to work.  The reason we feel good when we succeed is that our emotions are attached to our work.  It&rsquo;s why I get up in the morning.  But it&rsquo;s better to attach your feelings to how harsh you are on your code.  Understand that we all write terrible code, but that the difference between bad and good is that good coders recognize this fact and deal with it.</p>

<p>Because of the incredible complexity in software development of any kind, there simply is no room for mindless zealotry or attachment to a movement.  Every project, every site, every module is a little different, and has a slightly different standard of quality.  (Even the rule &ldquo;always head upwards&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work for climbing all kinds of mountains.)  Keep the goal in mind, and think about the best way to get there.  Sometimes it&rsquo;ll be the accepted standards, hell most of the time it probably will be, but sometimes it might not.  It&rsquo;s our job to know the difference.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, take a moment to re-evaluate your methods for evaluating the quality of your code.  You may have to let go of something comfortable, and it may sting, but in the end, you&rsquo;ll be better at what you do.</p>
