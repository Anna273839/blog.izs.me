<p><strong>Reddit user HeMeYou was left “overwhelmed” by advice from online strangers after accidentally discovering his son might be gay</strong>.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old father posed the question to Reddit after finding Google searches on his son’s iPad suggesting he wanted to come out.</p>
<p>He said: “I found out my 13 y/o son is gay… He hasn’t told me, but I want to support him. What can I do?”</p>
<p><em>I’m 38, and a single dad to my 13 year old son, 14 in four months. The other day I asked my son if I could borrow his iPad and he gave it to me.</em></p>
<p><em>After my first attempt at Google searching something I noticed that he forgot to delete his history as a lot of the search terms were along the lines of “I’m gay what now?” etc…</em></p>
<p><em>I love him regardless of which gender he loves, in fact when I was slightly older than him I had a few flings with guys, which he doesn’t know about, so I am 100% supportive.</em></p>
<p><em>He has seemed slightly down recently, as in, he isn’t as cheerful as he once was, and I desperately want to tell him that I love him regardless of which sexuality he is.</em></p>
<p><em>What are my options? Should I wait for him to tell me? Or should I make a few hints at it?</em></p>
<p><em>I’m worried that if I don’t hint at it, that he will be worried about something that he really doesn’t have to be worried about… if that makes sense.</em><br/><em> Thanks.</em></p>
<p>Shortly after, he received a flood of supportive messages, with many users offering advice based on their own experiences.</p>
<p>One user posted: “Google ‘how to tell my son I will love and support him no matter what’ and leave it in his search history.”</p>
<p>Another said: “Let him come out on his own terms, just make sure he knows that you’ll support him and you don’t have a problem with it.”</p>
<p>The father, who wished to remain anonymous, told Buzzfeed the response to his post was “overwhelmingly helpful and kind.”</p>
<p>A few days later, HeMeYou posted an update on what he ended up doing:</p>
<p><em>I started off with talking about general media with him, for instance I mentioned how awesome it was that Tim Cook (CEO of Apple) came out as being gay and I asked him what he thought about it and I was completely expecting him to give a typical teenager response like “yeah.. its good” or something like that but he actually gave me a detailed response which I absolutely loved because for the first time in a good while I’ve actually held a conversation with my son that felt really… rewarding.</em></p>
<p><em>I also wanted to talk to him about how I’ve noticed that he’s not been acting as cheerful as he usually has and I sort of gave the cliche spiel of “I love you no matter what and I just want to see you be happy” but I didn’t get much of a response that time apart from “yeah I know..”</em></p>
<p><em>The next day as I picked him up from school I thought I’d ask him about any crushes he has, and I wanted to make sure I didn’t say a gender when I asked him, so instead of ‘he’ or ‘she’ I used ‘they’ etc.. Here is that conversation as I remember it…</em></p>
<p><em>Me: So, do you have a crush on anyone?</em><br/><em> Son: Uhm… no..m..maybe..</em><br/><em> Me: Ohhh so who is the lucky person?</em><br/><em> At this point he sort of looked at me slightly confused, I’m not 100% sure why, but I’m assuming it is because I said “lucky person” rather than “lucky girl”.</em><br/><em> Son: Just someone from my french class…</em><br/><em> Me: Oh yeah… so what do you like about them?</em><br/><em> Son: Just.. stuff..</em><br/><em> Me: Okay.. but.. like what?</em><br/><em> Son: I donno they’re just kinda funny I guess…</em></p>
<p><em>At this point I dropped the conversation but just before I did I told him “Well, whoever it is, they should be so lucky to have you as a boyfriend..” and while I didn’t see it, I certainly felt as though he was rolling his eyes at my cheesy comments.</em></p>
<p><em>At the dinner table the same day, while we were eating we had a couple minutes of silence, not much was heard apart from the cutlery and my son finally said “I actually wanted to tell you something in the car, but I was afraid you’d get in an accident..”</em></p>
<p><em>I looked up from my plate and looked at him straight in the eyes… I could see he was thinking about something and all I could think of was “OMG this is it…”</em></p>
<p><em>He said “Dad..” with a couple seconds of silence “..I’m gay”.</em></p>
<p><em>I looked at him and couldn’t help myself from smiling, and I told him “____, you know I love you so much… right?” and I got up and gave him a huge hug.</em></p>
<p><em>He even started to cry on my shoulder and because of that I couldn’t help myself but shed a couple tears.</em></p>
<p>Concluding his post, he said: “After dinner and after he finished his homework we both lay in our pyjamas on the sofa, while I was watching the Cooking Channel and he was playing on his iPad.</p>
<p>“I had my arm around him and he was leaning his head on my chest, and all I could think of was that I’m the happiest father on earth right now.”</p>

<h2>"Code of conduct thoughts" with Anon Mous</h2>
<blockquote>

  <p>Hi Isaac</p>
  
  <p>I was going to put this on the GH thread but it has been locked, so I wanted to send it to you.</p>
  
  <p>Before I begin this comment I want to make clear a few things. I do think harassment happens in tech every day, it falls on socially marginalised groups overwhelmingly, and it needs to stop. I think that CoC&rsquo;s are a good thing for a community and agree with everything in <a href="http://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq#coc101why">here</a>. I&rsquo;m commenting anonymously because I don&rsquo;t feel safe to say this attached to my real identity.</p>
  
  <p>The CoC defines the rights and responsibilities of all members of the community. One of the rights of members is to not feel threatened, and if they do then to have a safe way to report that. The section on Addressing Grievances covers what someone can do if they feel they&rsquo;ve been unfairly accused of violating the CoC. This strikes a good balance in the case where the violation of the CoC has been brought to the organisers, evaluated, and then that person has been talked to about their behaviour.</p>
  
  <p><strong>However</strong> this doesn&rsquo;t cover the case where someone has also or only talked about the event in social media and the person has been harassed by a crowd on social media. By the time that the organisers have had a chance to look at the facts and make a decision, punishment may have already been meted out.</p>
  
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know what the answer is, but I think it&rsquo;s worth talking about the rights of the accused and the responsibilities of the reporter. In particular, should the reporter refrain from using social media to talk about the person or their actions, instead waiting until the organisers have had a chance to look into the claims?</p>
  
  <p>I&rsquo;m not sure that social media is always the right place for talking about these incidents, particularly when they have just happened. Additionally I think that often the intent of posting these incidents on social media is at least in part to damage the person they are accusing.</p>
  
  <p>I don&rsquo;t want to create a gag order, and I don&rsquo;t know what the right answer is here. I&rsquo;m aware that marginalised groups are at an extreme power imbalance when making reports, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to put anything in place that would make a marginalised person feel unsafe in attending an event, or reporting an incident. Perhaps we decide to be silent on this, leaving it up to the judgement of the person reporting it. If that is the case, then it still deserves to be discussed.</p>

  <p>Well, Mx. Mous, I think that you bring up a relevant point, but not one that is new or should direct any different course of action.</p>
  
  <p>Essentially, you are saying that the blowback against an accused harasser on social media channels may be disproportionate to their actions, and in particular, may make the jobs of project administrators more difficult as a result.</p>
  
  <p>This is a relevant concern.  However, let&rsquo;s dig in one step deeper, and look at the root.</p>
  
  <p>Abused people lash out on social media when they have no other outlet, or when other outlets are unlikely to be productive.  The best way we can address this is to make sure that victims of abuse are confident that their grievances will be addressed by the community admins.</p>
  
  <p>It is a myth that victims love or seek it out publicity.  Look at the actual effects that so-called &ldquo;professional victims&rdquo; have to look forward to.  No one would go through that if they had any other reasonable choice.  It is only a sense of justice that tends to compel them to make their abuse public for the good of others who might benefit from the warning.</p>
  
  <p>If we say &ldquo;THOU SHALT NOT SPEAK OF THIS ON SOCIAL MEDIA&rdquo;, as one of the rules of the CoC, then what we are <em>actually</em> saying is, &ldquo;As project administrators, we believe that you will be so dissatisfied by relying on us that you will have no other choice than to take the fight into the public; furthermore, we are unwilling to be held accountable for our actions in public, so we have added this caveat to absolve ourselves of responsibility if you escalate this issue.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>In fact, rather than ensuring that victims of abuse pursue the &ldquo;proper&rdquo; channels for their grievances, this sort of rule will tend to <em>increase</em> the likelihood of a public flamewar, which in practice tends to harm victims more than abusers.</p>
  
  <p>The best course of action is thus to clearly communicate that we will support victims of abuse and harassment, so much so that we are willing and eager to receive any feedback in public or private about how can do this better.</p>
  
  <p>If we do that, and leave it up to the best judgement of abuse victims how they go public, we will tend to find that almost no one opts to heap additional abuse and scrutiny on themselves.</p>
  
  <p>With your permission, I would like to post your question and this response publicly, because this is a common question.  I will not include the email headers.</p>

  <p>Thanks for this. You&rsquo;re totally right and I agree with you. I had some of these ideas floating around but you linked them together for me. I&rsquo;m happy for you to post this question and response publicly.</p>
  
  <p>Thanks, Mx Mous</p>
