<h2>Sexism, Words, and Marketing</h2>
<p>Go read this: <a href="http://storify.com/charlesarthur/oh-hai-sexism">Oh Hai Sexism</a>.  (Aside: I&rsquo;m finding that more and more of the news stories I really like are on <a href="http://storify.com">Storify</a>, which I first heard about as one of the earliest Node.js adopters.  Nice to see them doing well.)</p>

<p>Some of the confusion on the part of bystanders to this flame war was, &ldquo;So, there&rsquo;s a model being objectified in an underwear commercial.  What&rsquo;s the big deal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, a <em>very</em> important point here, I think, is that this video was not being used <em>solely</em> to sell underwear, and that&rsquo;s where it started going wrong.</p>

<p>Design Like Whoa is a clothing company.  Clothing companies use models to sell clothing.  Models are chosen for their looks, and they are <em>literally</em> objectified, as part of their job.  They&rsquo;re also consenting, and reasonably well paid.  This method of selling clothes is used by just about every single clothing company, because it works.  I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a single thing wrong with the video as such, qua underwear commercial, or at least, nothing that isn&rsquo;t <em>also</em> wrong with the whole clothing industry and our irrational ape-brained methods of choosing clothing, but I don&rsquo;t think DLW can be expected to change that.  It&rsquo;s actually relatively un-sexy, compared to other underwear commercials.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=victoria%27s+secret+commercial">Quid veritas</a></p>

<p>Add to this that Design Like Whoa markets their clothing by putting startup logos on them.  Not a terrible plan, I mean, if it moves clothes, why not, right?  People are passionate about the websites they use.  Lots of companies put various logos on things to sell them by associating with the brand.  <del>Allegedly, Geeklist gave DLW permission to use their logo, and then DLW made the video without Geeklist&rsquo;s involvement, and just happened to choose their branded apparel in the commercial.  I&rsquo;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt there.</del></p>

<p><i><ins id="edit-2012-03-23">Edit: Geeklist was &ldquo;involved&rdquo; with the making of the video, somewhere between &ldquo;It was all their idea&rdquo; and &ldquo;They asked for photos, and got a video.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s not very relevant to the points I&rsquo;m trying to make here, so I&rsquo;m not going to go into it any further.  <a href="http://designlikewhoa.tumblr.com/post/19791735980/response-to-geeklists-letter-after-reading">Gemma says this.</a>  Christian disputes (via private email) some of what she wrote, but not all.  There&rsquo;s definitely some room for interpretation.  I&rsquo;m not really interested in the finer points of how this started, as much as where it ended up.  Bottom line: no one intended to offend anyone at the start, but that doesn&rsquo;t actually matter in the end.</ins></i></p>

<p>The problem, however, came about when Geeklist decided to use a women&rsquo;s underwear commercial as a marketing technique for their own product, which is a social networking website for people in technology.</p>

<p>This was the first line crossed.  I hadn&rsquo;t seen that marketing, since I never use geeklist and don&rsquo;t really care about their product except for the fact that it&rsquo;s written in node.  (That&rsquo;s not intended as a slight against Geeklist.  It seems like a fine enough product.  I am just set in my ways.  I use twitter and github and IRC, and that&rsquo;s about the extent of my social networking.  I don&rsquo;t really use Facebook much, either.)  Using a model in underwear to sell underwear is fine.  Using a model in underwear to sell an inclusive social network for technologists?  Sends the wrong message.</p>

<p>So far, in my book, no major harm done.  Doing interesting things means taking risks, and taking risks means sometimes being wrong.  It&rsquo;s important to give people permission to make mistakes, or else nothing interesting happens.  <strong>The trade-off of that permission is the trust that they&rsquo;ll act appropriately when their mistakes are made known to them.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harthvader/status/182982567220363265">According to Heather Arthur</a>, at least one private complaint about the video was ignored.</p>

<p>Heather&rsquo;s email should have been taken as a red flag.  Heather is exactly the sort of person that geeklist <em>should</em> be trying to target: She&rsquo;s young, prolific, and very actively involved with several happening developer communities.  She is a paradigm example of Geeklist&rsquo;s money demographic.  Any principles aside, if she felt put off by their marketing, then the marketing is broken, period.</p>

<p>Shanley Kane complained about it publicly on Twitter.  Again, I can&rsquo;t really think of anyone more fitting the ideal Geeklist target demographic.  A product manager and marketeer at Basho (maker of Riak, one of the most relevant nosql databases), and also a Ruby coder and technical hobbyist.  Someone who goes to conferences and <strong>networks with technologists</strong> as her <strong>job</strong>.  Geeklist should be happy to get <em>any</em> feedback from her, and should take it extremely seriously if she&rsquo;s put off by their marketing.  Anything short of a brick through the window should have been accepted gratefully.</p>

<p>This was an opportunity.  There is rarely a case where the right answer is so obvious.  Christian could have replied, &ldquo;Good point. I&rsquo;m on it. We don&rsquo;t own the video, I&rsquo;ll talk to the person who does. No offense was intended. Thanks.&rdquo; and actually walked away from this event perhaps not a hero, but certainly not a villain.</p>

<p>Instead, he got defensive, and took offense at Shanley&rsquo;s &ldquo;insult&rdquo; to his &ldquo;brand&rdquo;.  News flash: you don&rsquo;t get to have a brand, or a project, or a company, or any public anything, without people insulting it.  People say &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; sometimes.  That&rsquo;s just how it works.</p>

<p>From there, it spiraled WAY out of control.  However much Shanley&rsquo;s &ldquo;cursing&rdquo; may have offended geeklist&rsquo;s brand, Reuben&rsquo;s and Christian&rsquo;s response to it was much worse.  The veiled threats about talking to Shanley&rsquo;s employer were just so far beyond what is sensible or appropriate, I am at a loss for words.</p>

<p>There was <a href="http://gklst.tumblr.com/post/19734620901/geeklist-and-a-public-apology">an apology</a>, and the video is now gone, which I guess is good.  But my two worst nopology pet peeves are in there: &ldquo;We apologize <i><b>if</b></i>&hellip;&rdquo;, and justifications for the behavior that they&rsquo;re ostensibly apologizing about.  Don&rsquo;t tell me why I <strong>shouldn&rsquo;t</strong> be offended, and then apologize <strong>if</strong> it was offensive.  Tell me why I <strong>should</strong> be offended, and then apologize <strong>because</strong> it was offensive.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeal/status/182984512261734400">Mikeal put it</a>, &ldquo;apologies that don&rsquo;t contain the words &quot;we fucked up&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t usually genuine.&ldquo;</p>

<p>Put aside your immediate feelings and keep your eye on your choices and their likely results.  This isn&rsquo;t just <em>part</em> of being a grown up, it&rsquo;s basically the <em>definition</em> of being a grown up.  People won&rsquo;t remember that you valiantly defended your brand from the vicious assault of an outraged feminist.  They&rsquo;ll remember that you insulted and intimidated the exact sort of person you&rsquo;re claiming to cater to, and you&rsquo;ll lose their trust.</p>

<p>Can we please go just a few weeks without some insecure startup founder pissing off a huge chunk of the technology community with macho antics?  And, really?  I don&rsquo;t care if you actually are a beer-chugging juggy-hooting misogynistic bro douchebag in the privacy of your own home.  Just please keep it out of twitter, the work place, conferences, and other public forums.  Just temporarily, in public, <em>pretend</em> to be grown ups.  Think about your words, and choose the ones most likely the have the effects you desire.</p>

<p>There are smart talented women going into applied science and fucking <strong>academia</strong> because of you asshats.  Clean up your act.  We need more good programmers, and you&rsquo;re scaring off half of them.</p>

<h2 id="addendum-2012-03-23">Addendum</h2>

<p>Just to clarify, I&rsquo;ve met Christian Sanz numerous times.  He seems like a really nice guy.  It&rsquo;s easy to get swept up in a flamewar and say stupid things, and a lot of us have done so.  They clearly realized much too late that the train was headed for crazy town, and fumbled awkwardly to try to change course.  I&rsquo;m more disappointed than angry about all this.  It&rsquo;s kind of sad, really.</p>

<p>A person is not just one conversation, and a product is not just one person.  My hope is that Geeklist (particularly Christian and Reuben) will learn from this event and let it inform their actions the next time someone criticizes their marketing decisions, rather than be so scared off from the event that they stop taking risks at all.</p>

<p>Watch this video.  I really like a lot of what he has to say.  Two main comments:</p>

<ol><li><strong>165</strong> Exceptions in the standard library, is <em>enough</em>!?  <strong>Are you fucking kidding me?</strong>  JavaScript has 7, and if you ask me, that&rsquo;s way too many.  <code>URIError</code> is completely unnecessary, and <code>EvalError</code> is always better off being expressed as something else.  The only Error types you ever need to use in your code are <code>Error</code> or <code>TypeError</code>.  That being said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t create a new exception type&rdquo; is 100% spot-on.  Even having typed catches in the language encourages this kind of awful profusion.</li>
<li>The reliance on &ldquo;the standard library&rdquo; is, imo, a bad thing.  The idea that we should not reinvent wheels is great.  s/standard library/npm registry/g and you&rsquo;ve got me.</li>
</ol><p>Many aspects of the Node.js module system, and the npm package registry, are built with exactly these principles in mind.</p>

<ol><li><code>module.exports</code> allows you to export a single thing from a module.  If I had the opportunity to do it again, I&rsquo;d only support that, rather than an <code>exports</code> object. If you really want to export multiple things, you&rsquo;d still be able to, but it should be an extra mental leap to do so.</li>
<li>The single-level namespace in the npm registry makes it a bit less likely to end up with garbage like <code>com.initech.utils.UtilityFactory.UtilityFactoryExceptions.UtilityFactoryNotFoundException</code>.  &ldquo;Namespaces are for preventing collisions, not for creating taxonomies.&rdquo;  I cheered when he said this.</li>
<li>Once upon a time, I foolishly implemented the proposed &ldquo;modules&rdquo; feature in package.json.  Ryan gave me a lot of shit about that and refused to support it in node, no matter how easy it was to do.  I realized (a bit too late) that he was absolutely right, and pissed off some folks by removing it.  Today, you get one <code>main</code> module defined in package.json.  That&rsquo;s it.  A package is a module.  Yes, a package is also a folder, and modules are files, so you <em>can</em> dive into it and get at its guts.  But it&rsquo;ll feel <em>off</em>, because it&rsquo;s weird, and non-standard.  You&rsquo;ll get funny looks.  <strong>This is on purpose,</strong> because it nudges you towards a flatter namespace by default.</li>
</ol><p>The social engineering in node and npm is always more carrot than stick, and we always try to nudge people in a good direction by saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to a feature rather than saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to one.  This hasn&rsquo;t been done perfectly in the past, but I am fairly proud of the results.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shock to someone who&rsquo;s used to writing giant monolithic programs, and has to re-think how they draw their boundaries.  That&rsquo;s good.  In fairly short order, things like local installs and limited exports start to &ldquo;click&rdquo; in a programmers mind most of the time.  I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people start out frustrated and angry, and then a month later tell me how odd it is to use other platforms that don&rsquo;t have the a similar approach.</p>

<p>When you solve a problem that others accept as the status quo, you often end up finding new problems.  You don&rsquo;t have to worry about coming up with unique descriptive names for your programs when you can nest them 7 layers deep underneath a company name.  You don&rsquo;t need to come up with approaches for managing a deep dependency graph if conflicts are insoluble.</p>

<h2>Addendum</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m against using classes.  I&rsquo;ve written several programs that use classes extensively.  It&rsquo;s the proper abstraction for a long-lived object that needs to keep state and be interacted with.  The hoop-jumping required to do this sort of thing in pure functional languages, with accumulator sets and so on, is kind of silly sometimes.</p>

<p>That being said, the <em>point</em> of using classes is to make things <em>easier</em>.  If your class is a fire-and-forget thing with a single method, then it&rsquo;s really just a function, and would be easier expressed in that manner.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no hard and fast rule here.  You have to actually think about what would make your program easier to use, easier to debug, and easier to understand.</p>

<h2>How I Would Do It</h2>
<p>One of the most common shorthands for evaluating the choices of others is to internally ask ourselves if we would make those same choices in the same situation.  If the choice is &ldquo;Not how I would do it&rdquo;, then it is deemed &ldquo;Bad&rdquo;, and reflects poorly on the chooser.</p>

<p>Like most sources of error, this shorthand is insidious precisely because it is a valuable time-saver in so many situations.  A person doing foolish things is likely a fool, and by establishing this aversion early, we can save ourselves the trouble of evaluating their future actions and words in depth.  If there&rsquo;s something that I know how to do &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s writing a JavaScript program or making meatloaf or listening to music or dating &ndash; then approaches that look <em>off</em> probably are.  Difference smells funny, and why look deeper?</p>

<p>Not every change is an improvement, but every improvement is a change.  We must be ever vigilant to not turn our noses up at progress simply because it is new, or at help simply because it comes in a shape somewhat different from what our own hands would make, or at a friend simply because they like different things.</p>
