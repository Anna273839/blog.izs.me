    "text": "<p>If you\u2019re a boy writer, it\u2019s a simple rule: you\u2019ve gotta get used to the fact that you suck at writing women and that the worst women writer can write a better man than the best male writer can write a good woman. And it\u2019s just the minimum. Because the thing about the sort of heteronormative masculine privilege, whether it\u2019s in Santo Domingo, or the United States, is you grow up your entire life being told that women aren\u2019t human beings, and that women have no independent subjectivity. And because you grow up with this, it\u2019s this huge surprise when you go to college and realize that, \u201cOh, women aren\u2019t people who does my shit and fucks me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And I think that this a huge challenge for boys, because they want to pretend they can write girls. Every time I\u2019m teaching boys to write, I read their women to them, and I\u2019m like, \u201cYo, you think this is good writing?\u201d These motherfuckers attack each other over cliche lines but they won\u2019t attack each other over these toxic representations of women that they have inherited\u2026 their sexist shorthand, they think that is observation. They think that their sexist distortions are insight. And if you\u2019re in a writing program and you say to a guy that their characters are sexist, this guy, it\u2019s like you said they fucking love Hitler. They will fight tooth and nail because they want to preserve this really vicious sexism in the art because that is what they have been taught.</p>\n\n<p>And I think the first step is to admit that you, because of your privilege, have a very distorted sense of women\u2019s subjectivity. And without an enormous amount of assistance, you\u2019re not even going to get a D. I think with male writers the most that you can hope for is a D with an occasional C thrown in. Where the average women writer, when she writes men, she gets a B right off the bat, because they spent their whole life being taught that men have a subjectivity. In fact, part of the whole feminism revolution was saying, \u201cMe too, motherfuckers.\u201d So women come with it built in because of the society. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s the same way when people write about race. If you didn\u2019t grow up being a subaltern person in the United States, you might need help writing about race. Motherfuckers are like \u2018I got a black boy friend,\u2019 and their shit sounds like Klan Fiction 101.</p>\n\n<p>The most toxic formulas in our cultures are not pass down in political practice, they\u2019re pass down in mundane narratives. It\u2019s our fiction where the toxic virus of sexism, racism, homophobia, where it passes from one generation to the next, and the average artist will kill you before they remove those poisons. And if you want to be a good artist, it means writing, really, about the world. And when you write cliches, whether they are sexist, racist, homophobic, classist, that is a fucking cliche. And motherfuckers will kill you for their cliches about x, but they want their cliches about their race, class, queerness. They want it in there because they feel lost without it. So for me, this has always been the great challenge.</p>\n\n<p>As a writer, if you\u2019re really trying to write something new, you must figure out, with the help of a community, how can you shed these fucking received formulas. They are received. You didn\u2019t come up with them. And why we need fellow artists is because they help us stay on track. They tell you, \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re a bit of a fucking homophobe.\u201d You can\u2019t write about the world with these simplistic distortions. They are cliches. People know art, always, because they are uncomfortable. Art discomforts. The trangressiveness of art has to deal with confronting people with the real. And sexism is a way to avoid the real, avoiding the reality of women. Homophobia is to avoid the real, the reality of queerness. All these things are the way we hide from encountering the real. But art, art is just about that.</p>",
