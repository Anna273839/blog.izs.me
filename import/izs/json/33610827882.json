And the way you correct biases isn\u2019t by pretending they don\u2019t exist.</p>\n\n<p>A very valid question is, \u201cWhy should we care?\u201d  Maybe that\u2019s what Antirez was trying, in a rather clumsy way, to get at.  What\u2019s wrong with tech being composed almost entirely of men?  After all, we should be a meritocracy; what\u2019s in your underwear shouldn\u2019t matter, right?</p>\n\n<p>The reason we should care is that rational grownups don\u2019t just shrug their shoulders when their biases cause hardships for other people.  Rational grownups try to see the world as it is (including themselves), and don\u2019t make up excuses for facts.  We should care because a diversity of opinions benefits all of us, and our industry, and we\u2019re subconsciously filtering people based on criteria that we claim does not matter.</p>\n\n<p>But mostly, we should care because there are humans being treated like shit, and we are part of the problem.</p>",
