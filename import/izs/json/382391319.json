Throw it away.  Maybe it had some good parts, fine.  You can look at them, but you&rsquo;re not allowed to copy and paste <em>anything</em>.  Type it out again.

This is where the vision takes shape.</p>\n\n<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t to end up with something clever.  It&rsquo;s to end up with something obvious.  The solution should simply seem to grow out of the problem and attach to it, like its natural symbiotic twin.

Write some more test cases to cover areas that the suite doesn&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<p>If it&rsquo;s text, then read it over and over.  Scrutinize every word to make sure it means exactly what you want.  Go to bed and wake up and read it again.  Have other people read it and push them to be really critical.  Ask them what they thought, and make notes of where it&rsquo;s different from your intent.</p>\n\n<p>Return to step 2 as necessary.</p>\n\n<h2>Step 4: Optimize</h2>\n\n<p>We always want to put this step earlier in the process, but that&rsquo;s almost always a mistake.
