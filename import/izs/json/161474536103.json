Be the person your company needs you to be right now.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019d think that would be obvious, but the opposite happens all the time. People get hired thinking they\u2019re going to be doing task A, discover there\u2019s more task B to be done, and declare \u201cthat\u2019s not my job\u201d. Okay, sure, it\u2019s disappointing you don\u2019t get to do A. But the company is not going to create a job for you doing A.

They\u2019re doing A, they want to be doing B, they start picking up any B that happens to be lying around. That\u2019s great! You should do that. But not if it means A doesn\u2019t get done. When the company is big enough that you need two full-time people doing A and B, you can pick which one you do.
