At least in the near- to mid-term, we would be continuing to build these sorts of (largely, very successful) branded world sites.  After all, if a team of 3 can deliver on a high-six-figure deal in 2 weeks, well, that&rsquo;s the kind of gravy businesses dream about.

And a good old-fashioned wallop of a failure is traditionally what sets a product back on track.  However, without too much back-patting, the team that I was working on was completely stocked with talented and dedicated engineers who simply would not allow failure to happen, even if it meant working late nights and weekends.  The result?  We worked late nights and weekends, and stressed out over these projects.  This wasn&rsquo;t the project we agreed to work on, and we were getting a bit fed up.

Yahoo probably extended my employment here considerably, and certainly increased my morale greatly, by just finding something else for me to do.  Just ask them now and then what they want and how they feel about what you&rsquo;re doing, and you&rsquo;ll probably find that they could be even more valuable than they are.</p>",
