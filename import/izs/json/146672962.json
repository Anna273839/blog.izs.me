I know a handful of my colleagues will vehemently disagree and point at countless approaches to enable virtually any kind of reskinning using only CSS changes. (I\u2019ve used <a href=\"http://www.lesliesommer.com/wdw07/html/\">Leslie Sommer\u2019s CSS Mojo</a> technique to great success in the past; we used it for pretty much everything on <a href=\"http://buzz.yahoo.com\">Yahoo!

What kind of crazy lunatic writes <em>all their HTML by hand in text files</em>, anyhow?

If everyone uses the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag for markup, guess what happens: <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> is now a semantically meaningless (or at least, semantically vague) tag, and any user agents that might care about navigating tabular data have to deal with that fact.

(Most so-called DHTML is actually just manipulating CSS with Javascript, and the Javascript is pretty light.) CSS can do some things that table tags can\u2019t, so you ought to learn it.

Test it in the user agents that you expect to support. Stop debating the color of this bikeshed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    If there\u2019s ever a good reason to go back and change your tables to divs, or vice versa, you can do that. Hell, plan for that, because whether you use CSS for layout or not, you\u2019re going to need to touch your markup sometimes.

That\u2019s not to say that the existing state of the CSS language is perfect. In fact, even the most vocal CSS advocates regularly assert that there are deep problems with the existing spec and browser support.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Tables are (for various reasons cited elsewhere ad nauseam), in most cases, a more optimal metaphor than any of its rivals. There\u2019s nothing inherently wonderful about the tags themselves. In fact, even the most vocal table advocates regularly assert that the markup is ugly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Therein lies the crux of the problem. CSS is a great technological approach, and tables are a great metaphor. The question then usually becomes, <q>Should I mark up my content using <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags or <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tags?</q>, which really means, <q>Is the separation of style from content more or less important than using the optimal layout metaphor?</q> The debate goes a little like this:\n</p>\n\n<dl><dt>\n        tables\n    </dt>\n    <dd>\n        <p>\n            This layout metaphor is better, so you should use these tags. All you idealists are unrealistic! (Also, if you think markup matters, you believe in fairies. It so doesn\u2019t!)\n        </p>\n    </dd>\n    <dt>\n        CSS\n    </dt>\n    <dd>\n        <p>\n            Metaphor shmetaphor! You don\u2019t care about the sanctity of data or code quality. Think of the maintenance! (Also, if you can\u2019t do it with divs, you\u2019re stupid. It\u2019s so easy!)\n        </p>\n    </dd>\n</dl><p>\n    The Right Answer, it would seem, is to use the table metaphor with the CSS technology. In the ideal world, you\u2019d always mark up your content using the tags that would communicate your meaning most clearly to your intended user agents. Then you\u2019d tell user agents how to treat those tags visually. To describe this visual display, you should be able to use the table metaphor, or the float metaphor, or absolute and relative positioning, or anything else, <strong>but that should not be done by your markup</strong>.\n</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting_real\">\n    Getting Real\n</h3>\n\n<p>\n    In the real world, it\u2019s not so nice. The CSS specification has a set of display values designed to mimic the table tags, but they aren\u2019t well supported, and anyway, it\u2019s an imperfect imitation of a hack that was not really intended to be used the way we all ended up using it.\n</p>\n\n<p>In other words, CSS is not an ideal example of what CSS aims at, and the table/tr/td tags are not an ideal implementation of the table/grid metaphor.  CSS tables, though they <em>are</em> clever and in some cases quite useful, take it from bad to worse.</p>\n\n<p>\n    The state of the CSS art is not at a point where you can realistically expect to make any significant stylistic changes to your pages without altering the markup. If you need to move the navigation bar from the right to the left, or re-skin the page with dropshadows instead of rounded corners, or convert your gradients from 2-tone to 3-tone, or make your boxes vertically centered instead of top-aligned, you\u2019re probably going to have to change your markup, at least a little.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    In theory, it\u2019s possible. I know a handful of my colleagues will vehemently disagree and point at countless approaches to enable virtually any kind of reskinning using only CSS changes.
