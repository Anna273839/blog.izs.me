The time at which this occurs is flexible, but if you&rsquo;re targeting a fixed release date, it&rsquo;d better be soon!  If you don&rsquo;t build in enough time for research, then the product will not be satisfactory.</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000981.html\">Your estimates suck.</a>  And they&rsquo;ll keep sucking, no matter what you do.

But, since project managers typically aren&rsquo;t programmers dealing with the software each day, they need our input.

Streamline every part of the meeting that requires their attention.  Focus their time on what you actually need them to weigh in on.  Have estimates prepared, and ask them to critique them.  Wrapping it in silly games won&rsquo;t help&mdash;that just makes it take longer.  <strong>Programmers hate project management.</strong>  So make them do as little of it as possible.  Trust me, if they wanted to be project managers, <strong>they wouldn&rsquo;t have degrees in computer science.</strong>  Let them get back to work.  There&rsquo;s no worse blocker than having to stop coding for a meeting.  Like torture or invasive surgery, it&rsquo;d better be necessary, otherwise it&rsquo;s all kinds of wrong.

It&rsquo;s still best if everyone can physically see the people that they&rsquo;re working with from where they sit, but that&rsquo;s not always possible.  Even in that case, forcing everyone to stand up for a few minutes each morning and tell everyone what they&rsquo;re up to is a good way to make sure that the team doesn&rsquo;t get sidetracked or splintered.

Even in that case, forcing everyone to stand up for a few minutes each morning and tell everyone what they&rsquo;re up to is a good way to make sure that the team doesn&rsquo;t get sidetracked or splintered.

            "content_raw": "<p>Software development is not like manufacturing.</p>\n\n<p>In manufacturing, you build to the same specifications over and over again.\nIn software development, you create a new thing each time, and the specifications typically change along the way.</p>\n\n<p>In manufacturing, 100 factories can generally produce 100 times as many things as 1 factory.  Adding a new factory means that more things will be produced.\n20 programmers are far less productive than 5.  Adding another programmer often means that the project will be delayed even further.</p>\n\n<p>In manufacturing, you can gradually tune your methods based on past experience, and become more efficient over time.\nIn software development, past problems generally have little if anything to do with future problems.  The best you can hope for is to find and learn very broad abstract efficiency boosters like \u201cbest practices.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Manufacturing and software development are similar in what I think of as the \u201cexpert effect.\u201d  Generally speaking, for a given task and a given group of people, one of them will be best at that task.  If that expert is given control of that task, then they will tend to do it well; if they are forced to take input from everyone else in the group who isn\u2019t as good as them, then the task will tend to suffer, if only from the time required to evaluate the input and decide not to use it.  Management is one such task, perhaps the most important one.</p>\n\n<p>Most people I know seem to accept these premises.  That is, unless you\u2019re an Agile Scrum zealot.  Then you may think that:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Specifications change, but that\u2019s OK, because it\u2019s \u201citerative design\u201d.</li>\n    <li>You can predict how long something will take, and your predictions will get better over time.</li>\n    <li>Tasks can be broken down based on the time required, and can be assigned to any \u201cqualified\u201d person.</li>\n    <li>Programming experts will be happier if they do project management, and are qualified to do so.</li>\n</ol><p>This is all 100% bullshit.  In the real world:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Specifications change because it\u2019s virtually impossible to design something that\u2019s never been done if you can\u2019t see it as you go along.  The specs stop changing when the team puts their collective foot down to management and the customer, and that\u2019s when \u201cresearch\u201d stops and \u201cdevelopment\u201d begins.  The time at which this occurs is flexible, but if you\u2019re targeting a fixed release date, it\u2019d better be soon!
