It wants to know you&rsquo;re prepared, that you&rsquo;ve run all your tests.  It will help you find friends and allies, try to warn you which ones to steer clear of.  This can be a little smothering at times, but when your program is out there in the wild, maybe you&rsquo;ll <code>require()</code> a little something, and there it&rsquo;ll be, because of how much npm cared for it, and it&rsquo;ll think warmly of the place it grew up, back in the <code>$HOME</code> directory on your laptop.</p>\n\n<p>This mental image is what inspired the &ldquo;npm loves you&rdquo; meme.

It won&rsquo;t go out of its way to be a jerk, but if there&rsquo;s ever a choice between being fast and being nice, you know what it&rsquo;s going to pick.  If something needs to break between versions, well, then that&rsquo;s what has to happen.

Of course, to some extent, every platform is a tool for interacting with the system, but you really want a different personality from your platform than you do from a tool.

I think there&rsquo;s a lot of truth to this.  But, just as children don&rsquo;t necessarily grow up into copies of their parents, software&rsquo;s personality doesn&rsquo;t necessarily match the <em>personality</em> of its creator.
