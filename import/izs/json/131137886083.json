    "text": "<p>So, my original goal was to portray a society that genuinely did not care about gender. Using a single pronoun for everyone was just one part of that, but the more I played with it, the more interesting the effect was. Ultimately, of course, using \u201cshe\u201d for everyone doesn\u2019t actually convey gender neutrality, and I realized that pretty quickly. But I think if I\u2019d chosen to use a gender neutral pronoun\u2014e, or sie, or zie, or any of the others\u2014it would have produced an interesting effect, but it would have lost the way that \u201cshe\u201d automatically goes straight to the reader\u2019s perceptions. No, that\u2019s not the best way to say it. I mean, the very long familiarity long-time English speakers have with the pronouns \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d means that we react to them without actually thinking much about it. We don\u2019t stop to ask ourselves what they mean, they just go right in and trigger a particular set of associations, almost automatically, unconsciously. By using \u201cshe\u201d for everyone, I get (for many, but of course not all readers) the effect, once those associations are triggered, of undermining or questioning them, in a very basic way, a sort of\u2026 experiential way. It\u2019s one thing to tell someone about the masculine default, and have them understand the idea. It\u2019s another thing to actually demonstrate how it works on your reader. But it only works (for the readers it worked for, because of course it didn\u2019t work for everyone) because we parse those pronouns so thoughtlessly.</p>\n\n<p>The various gender neutral pronouns don\u2019t have that long familiarity for most of us. The effect I mention above, which quite a few readers have explicitly commented on and appreciated, would have been lost if I\u2019d used one of them. It was a trade-off, I think. I can\u2019t blame folks who wish I\u2019d used a gender neutral pronoun instead, of course, and I\u2019m hoping to see those pronouns used more so that they become more generally familiar. I\u2019m seeing singular \u201cthey\u201d for known people (instead of the nebulous \u201cdon\u2019t know who this might actually be\u201d use of singular they) used well in short fiction lately, and I\u2019ve been really happy to see it. But myself, for this particular project, I think the effect that I got, at least with a sizable number of readers, was worth the trade-off.</p>\n\n<p>So, in some ways I succeeded. In other ways I didn\u2019t. But the result was interesting and gave a lot of people something to think about and discuss, and I\u2019m glad of that.</p>",
