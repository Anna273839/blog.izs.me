    "text": "<p>I am 16. I\u2019m dancing to my favorite pop song at my friends birthday party when a boy whose name I do not even know comes over and slaps my ass. My face flushes with redness and I sit down for the rest of the night avoiding the eyes of everyone in the room.</p>\n\n<p>Later, I ask him why he thought it was okay to invade my body without my consent. He says it was a joke.</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t laugh.</p>\n\n<p>I am 12. Every girl in my grade is dragged to the school\u2019s auditorium, where we are told that \u2018dressing like sluts\u2019 in ninety degree will not be tolerated, and that we will get two detentions if anyone finds our clothing distracting.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Later, I find out that, while we were being lectured on our own bodies, all of the boys stayed in their homerooms and watched a movie, because \u2018It\u2019s natural for boys to get aroused, the girls are the ones that have to cover up, they\u2019re causing a problem and taking away from the education of others.\u2019\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t understand any of it.</p>\n\n<p>I am 7. \u00a0I stand up at bat in gym class and\u00a0blatantly\u00a0miss the hollow plastic ball that is thrown in my direction. The whole class bursts out laughing. \u2018You hit like a girl,\u2019 one of the boys hollers to me.</p>\n\n<p>Later, I ask my female gym teacher why hitting \u2018like a girl\u2019 is a bad thing. She smiles at me sympathetically as she says \u2018Honey, it just is.\u2019</p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t smile back.</p>\n\n<p>I am a girl, and since the day I was born, my gender has become synonymous to weakness, incapability, and\u00a0inadequacy.</p>",
