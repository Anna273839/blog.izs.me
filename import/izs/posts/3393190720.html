<h2>How this works...</h2>
<p>programmer 1: Hey, it turns out you don't need semicolons in JavaScript, and my previous reasons for putting them there are not actually true.  Neat.<br>
programmer 2: Yeah, but it'll break.<br>
p1: But... that's just it, it *doesn't* break.  It's actually ok for me to do this.<br>
p2: No it isn't.<br>
p1: Why not?<br>
p2: Browser bugs.<br>
p1: Which browsers?<br>
p2: All of them.<br>
p1: Well, it works fine on all the engines I've tested---<br>
p2: IE.<br>
p1: Works fine there, too.  Even in IE 5.<br>
p2: Compression.  Compressors can't handle it. Need the semicolons.  All of them.<br>
p1: All the compressors in use today handle it fine.  In fact, the code compresses a little *better* in most of them.<br>
p2: Well, whatever, that's not how it's done.<br>
p1: Ok, well, there are other reasons to do things besides a convention.  I mean, you're wearing an unconventional hat, and that's cool.<br>
p2: So, now you have a problem with my coding style AND my hat?? FUCK YOU.<br>
p1: You can code however you want, and I love your hat, I was ju---<br>
p2: No.  NO.  Fuck you.  Seriously.  You crossed a line, dude.  Too far.<br>
p1: [puzzled] I don't get why this an issue, I mean, if you see the spec, it says---<br>
p2: You just can't let this go, can you?  Why don't you lighten up?<br>
p1: Let what go, exactly?  And I don't really think that I'm the one who needs to lighten anything.<br>
p2: Oh, so now you come in with the personal attacks.  I get it.  We're all not smart enough to understand your precious spec, so you have to attack people?  HAVE YOU NO DECENCY, SIR?  AT LONG LAST, HAVE YOU NO DECENCY?<br>
p1: I think maybe hacker news isn't for me...</p>
