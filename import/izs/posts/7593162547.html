<h2>Nuno's</h2>
<p>nuno: Email is such a huge part of my life.  I need to say "No" to a lot of people.<br>
isaacs: It'd be cool if there was an app to do that for you.<br>
nuno: Yeah, it could be almost like an autoresponder or something.<br>
isaacs: And you could have some kind of Markov thing to come up with innovative and creative ways to say no to everything.<br>
nuno: That'd be great!<br>
isaacs: You should write that.  You could call it "Nuno's New No's".<br>
mikeal: You were thinking about that for a while, huh?<br>
isaacs: It was either that or a rhinoplasty joke.</p>
