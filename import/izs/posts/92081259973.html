<h2>Delusional Pets</h2>
<p>rockbot: I know you said no dogs, but can we pleeeeeeeease have a platypus-friendly office!?<br>
isaacs: I don't know.  Our office is pretty dry.  They need water.<br>
rockbot: That's why we'd get a tank!<br>
isaacs: Isn't it also like, super cold here for them?<br>
rockbot: They're nocturnal!  So it'd just come out at night.<br>
isaacs: Why not just *imagine* a platypus being here when you're home at night?  This isn't a pet-friendly office, but it's *definitely* a delusion-friendly office.<br>
rockbot: Really?<br>
isaacs: Yeah, have you *seen* the spreadsheets and graphs we show investors?  This is a startup, it's practically nothing *but* delusions!</p>
