<h2>On Eich.</h2>
<p><a href="http://vowelboy.tumblr.com/post/81633637492/on-eich" class="tumblr_blog">vowelboy</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Reducing the Eich sitaution to an argument about “seeing things from a point of view” is rather facile.</p>

<p>The man <em>actively</em> contributed to an action that removed a (previously granted) set of rights / privileges from a certain group of people.</p>

<p>He was appointed to a leadership position of an organisation that has an enormous presence in a community with a well-established standard for expectations of equality.</p>

<p>That community rallied and made their voice clear: “This behavior is unacceptable from a leader in our community.”</p>

<p>Rather than engaging with the community to build a bridge and address their concerns, Eich chose to step down.</p>

<p>Eich was not “bullied out of a job.”</p>

<p>This is not a case of being an innocent victim of an uncommonly held opinion. This is a case of a community not tolerating the <em>actions</em> of one of its appointed leaders.</p></blockquote>
