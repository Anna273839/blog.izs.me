<h2>On Building Bridges</h2>
<p>To the hot-take authors, politicians, and liberals asking us to build bridges.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an incomplete list of people more deserving of our empathy right now than white heartland voters, in no particular order:</p>

<ul><li>Muslim Americans who watched in horror as the GOP candidate successfully campaigned on a platform of targeting them with state violence.</li>
<li>The people of Puerto Rico, who live under US federal rule without representation or voice in the electoral process.</li>
<li>Everyone who is unable to vote for the rest of their lives due to a conviction for a nonviolent offense.</li>
<li>Native peoples facing further destruction of their homes in the name of oil.</li>
<li>The peaceful protestors in North Dakota holding their ground against rubber bullets, riot gear, and attack dogs.</li>
<li>The millions of people whose drinking water will be in jeopardy of contamination due to the oil pipeline those protestors are protesting.</li>
<li>Black people.  Just, all of them, everywhere.  But especially black women, who showed up for Hillary more than any other group.</li>
<li>All non-white people, who now face hate that has been emboldened by Trump&rsquo;s win.</li>
<li>Everyone whose vote was restricted by voter ID laws and other policies that violate the Voting Rights Act.</li>
<li>The 20 million people depending on the ACA for access to medical care.</li>
<li>The millions of disabled people whose legal and medical lifelines Trump has promised to remove.</li>
<li>Same-sex couples, whose families and marriages will face concerted attack from the federal government in the near future.</li>
<li>Transgender people, who only just recently started seeing progress towards equitable treatment and protection by the federal government, and can expect that to roll back.</li>
<li>Basically the entire LGBTQ community, no longer safe from discrimination in their jobs, homes, hospitals, or anywhere else.</li>
<li>The millions of women relying on Planned Parenthood for reliable and safe access to reproductive healthcare.</li>
<li>The civilians living in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and everywhere else where the US maintains a state of constant dangerous wartime readiness.</li>
<li>International allies and trade partners of the US.</li>
<li>Teachers doing their best to curb bullying of children, with inadequate resources.</li>
<li>Everyone who has immigrated to this country, who will be 1 misplaced document away from sudden deportation or worse.</li>
<li>Victims of rape and sexual assault, watching as a predator ascends to the highest office in the land.</li>
<li>The next few generations of earthlings, who may be the last, as we quickly make the planet too hot to inhabit.</li>
</ul><p>When you&rsquo;ve summoned empathy and built bridges with all of the people on this list, let&rsquo;s start talking about the Trump voters who attacked all these groups this week.</p>
