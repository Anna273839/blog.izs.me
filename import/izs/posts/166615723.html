<h2>Loyalty</h2>
<p>Send up the red flags and alarms whenever you hear this word. 10&rsquo;ll get you 20, it&rsquo;s a scam of some sort.  Sniff around.</p>

<p>There are only two things to be loyal to in this world: your self, and your integrity. And usually, if you lose one, the other goes along with it.</p>

<p>If any other &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; seems to collide with those two—family, party, country, job, what-have-you—you&rsquo;re in trouble. Drop it like a bad habit. Run fast. That ship is sinking.</p>

<p>In other words, &ldquo;I got only two things in this world: my word, and my balls. And I don&rsquo;t break ’em for nobody.&rdquo;</p>
