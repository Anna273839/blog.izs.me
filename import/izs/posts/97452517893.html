<h2><a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc54.2012/SolesKunyoGeedom/index.html">Postmodern geekdom as simulated ethnicity</a></h2>
<p>Wow.  Fascinating breakdown of the origin, development, and nature of the “geek” in popular culture, from R. Crumb to Frank Miller to The Dude.  <a href="http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc54.2012/SolesKunyoGeedom/index.html">Go read it.</a></p>

<p>The tl;dr is that the “geek” is a “simulated ethnicity”, assumed to tell a melodramatic story of triumph over adversity that lends credibility and moral authority to an otherwise unremarkable and unsympathetic member of the privileged class, who still vies for success within a traditional misogynistic, patriarchal, homophobic paradigm.</p>

<p>Absolutely love this bit at the end:</p>

<blockquote><p>What of the female geek? For the geek conceit to play out in its most misogynistic form, she must be missing. … [The female non-geek character] is elevated for her lack of geekiness because she is required to act as the reward the geek or “nice guy” feels entitled to in traditional patriarchal narratives. There is a missing character: the true geek female counterpart … who is loved for her brains and not for looks … This missing character lays bare the misogyny of geek melodrama.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yep.  “Laid bare” is right.</p>
