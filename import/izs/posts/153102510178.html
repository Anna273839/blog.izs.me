<h2>Reclaim Red</h2>
<p>Hillary Clinton was judged to be too much of an insider. She didn&rsquo;t have a story for the disaffected working class voter who sees a mechanized future where they have no place. A voter who wants something, anything, as long as it&rsquo;s different. They&rsquo;ll find out soon enough that this isn&rsquo;t what they got. </p>

<p>The obvious solution: radicalism. An obstinate hard left anti-capitalist socialist workers&rsquo; movement, focused on: systematically destroying and tearing down the institutions of corruption, including the electoral college and the military industrial complex; nationalizing banking, health care, and higher education; criminalizing the bribery of representatives by corporate interests; providing civilian oversight for police; restoring protection for voting rights and establishing universal suffrage as a constitutionally protected right; ending slavery by abolishing private prisons and mandatory minimum sentencing; ending wage slavery by establishing universal basic income for all Americans; streamlining the process of naturalization and providing amnesty for so-called &ldquo;illegals&rdquo; who wish to become naturalized. </p>

<p>Such a movement would have the right amount of social justice, scapegoating, catchy slogans, and could unite oppressed minorities and disaffected heartland whites. We can reclaim what it means to be a&quot; red state&quot;.</p>

<p>It is time, comrades! ☭</p>
