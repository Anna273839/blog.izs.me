<h2>Hey Buzzfeed. I like a lot of the stuff you guys do, but I've noticed something lately that makes me (and I assume a lot of other people) question whether or not to read your website. It seems like a disproportionate number of your articles and videos cater to women and so-called "feminists". This very blog recently posted a picture that mocked the new and popular #Meninist activist movement. Do you REALLY want your readers to think you support so-called "feminist" ideology?</h2>

<blockquote><p>Yes. Unequivocally yes.</p></blockquote><p>Oh, Anonymous, you crazy ol&rsquo; shitbird.  Up to your old tricks again.</p>

<p>So much lol @ &ldquo;so-called &quot;feminist&rdquo; ideology&quot;.  Scare quotes ftw.</p>
