<h2>Wrench</h2>
<p>When you have a wrench, all problems look like fucked up nail that didn&rsquo;t get hammered in quite right.</p>

<p>But if you pull on it, you can straighten it, so really, I don&rsquo;t see what the problem is, I mean, it couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious, and clearly, a wrench is the best tool for any jobs it can do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a really nice wrench, if people would just learn to use it properly, then their nails would be fine.</p>
