<p>They Might Be Giants played a hell of a show at the Berkeley UC Theater. They did two sets (opening for themselves). On the way out I heard some guy say he got the set list and I felt sharp pangs of envy, but I got a picture of it. Which, really, is for the best because all I&rsquo;d do if I&rsquo;d been the one to grab the list is take a picture and then guiltily keep the faded paper for too long and then guiltily throw it away eventually. </p>

<p>A tmbg show is a thing of beauty. Their catalog is so huge, and they&rsquo;re still so prolific, it&rsquo;s a good bet that they&rsquo;ll play a few songs you&rsquo;d forgotten, a few you don&rsquo;t know, a few you just started listening to, and your favorite from a long time ago. And a surprising cover or two. (In this case, it was &ldquo;pay my bills&rdquo; by Destiny&rsquo;s Child.) Plus they&rsquo;re hilarious, and rock stars.  (at The UC Theatre)</p>
