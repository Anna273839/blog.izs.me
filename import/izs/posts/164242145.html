<p>Sarah: Food is an experience for all 5 senses.<br>
Fried: I don't know about you, but I don't feel up my food.<br>
Isaac: What do you do with it in your mouth?<br>
Sarah: Yeah, you don't just feel it up, you have oral sex with your food.<br>
Isaac: Then later, you have butt sex with your food.<br>
Fried: ...<br>
Sarah: ... yeah... but.. going out instead of in...<br>
Isaac: Eh. Hits all the same spots.<br>
Fried: This conversation just got a lot less appetizing.</p>
