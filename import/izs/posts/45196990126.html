<p>Got this email this morning:</p>

Subject: Have a minute to talk about npmjs.org?

Hello,

We have a client interested in npmjs.org. Would you
consider selling the site?

Please let me know a day, time and phone number
you could speak about this possibility and we'll try
to make it work on our end.

I look forward to speaking with you.

Regards,

I will sell npmjs.org for USD $1,000,000,000.00.

<p>Just so you know.  If npmjs.org ever suddenly turns into some random e-commerce site or something, and I&rsquo;m nowhere to be found, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m crazy rich now and give zero fucks.</p>
